4	5	0	1	99	Alexander has already had enough close contact with that fire!
4	43	0	1	99	The hunter's lamp is now empty, and there's no reason to put embers in it.

4	56	0	1	99	There's no reason to put embers in a lamp.
4	1	0	1	99	The embers from the bonfire are still smoldering, despite the rain.
4	62	0	1	99	The neck of the milk bottle is too narrow for the embers.
4	51	13	1	99	Alexander exchanges the embers in his skull for more red-hot embers from the fire.
4	51	14	1	99	Alexander exchanges the embers in the skull for more red-hot embers from the fire, being careful not to disturb the rest of the skull's contents.
4	51	16	1	99	The skull already contains hot embers.
4	51	11	1	99	Alexander scoops up some of the red-hot embers in the ancient human skull.
4	2	0	1	99	The smoldering bonfire embers do not reply.
4	44	0	1	99	The china cup is too small and delicate for those large, red-hot embers.
9	0	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't want to do anything with that wicker cage ever again!
9	5	0	1	99	Alexander wants nothing more to do with that wicker cage!
9	1	0	1	99	The wicker cage that was to be Alexander's fiery coffin is now lying on the ground.  Alexander is glad to be out of that cage!
9	2	0	1	99	Alexander has no desire to talk to that wretched cage!
7	0	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't need to do anything to the circle of stones.
7	5	0	1	99	The giant stones are smooth and cold, and still damp from the rain.
7	1	0	1	99	Alexander is standing in a circle of giant stones.  He marvels at the complex yet simple design of the standing monoliths.
7	2	0	1	99	The stone sentinels do not reply.
6	0	0	1	99	Alexander has no reason to use that on the old tree.
6	5	0	1	99	The branches of the old tree are well out of Alexander's reach.
6	1	0	1	99	A gnarled old tree stretches a wide branch out over the smoldering bonfire.
3	1	0	1	99	Alexander is standing in the Druids' circle of giant stones.  The Rain Festival has ended, and the Druids have returned to their village to sleep.  The bonfire still smolders in the center of circle.
3	2	0	1	99	The Druids have left, and there's no one here to talk to.
1	0	1	1	99	Alexander is frozen at the spectacle before him; robed figures are gathered around a bonfire.  Some mystical ceremony is taking place, but as to its purpose, Alexander has no clue.
1	0	1	2	59	"Brothers, look!"
1	0	1	3	99	Uh, oh!  Alexander's been seen!
1	0	1	4	26	"This must be the foreigner we were warned about.  How appropriate that he should come during our Rain Festival.  Place him in the sacrificial cage!"
1	0	1	5	2	"(SHOUTING) Wait!  I must rescue the princess!"
1	0	1	6	26	"There's an ancient Druid saying:  'A man who would save others must first save himself!'"
1	0	1	7	99	Alexander is pushed into the confining wicker cage.
1	0	1	8	99	And the cage is swung out over the bonfire!
1	0	8	1	59	"We found a trespasser on the beach, Arch Druid!"
1	0	8	2	99	Uh, oh!  Arch Druid?  Now what has Alexander wandered into?
1	0	10	1	26	"I must apologize for our rude welcoming committee.  We've been feeling inhospitable ever since the Winged Ones stole our sacred miniature oak tree."
1	0	10	2	26	"Besides, Vizier Alhazred sent a message that we were to watch out for a highly-dangerous foreign assassin.  I assume you ARE the one he meant."
1	0	10	3	2	"I'm sure I'm precisely who he meant.  I assure you, I mean to harm no one--unless that person threatens the princess.  I'm sorry to have disrupted your ceremony, but I'm running out of time."
1	0	10	4	26	"What is it that you seek?"
1	0	10	5	2	"The Oracle on the Isle of the Sacred Mountain told me I should speak to you about the Realm of the Dead.  She told me of two souls in unrest there that I might be able to free."
1	0	10	6	26	"Free souls in the Realm of the Dead?  You're mad!"
1	0	10	7	2	"The souls might be able to help me on my mission to save the princess.  It's imperative that I do everything I can.  The risks are not important."
1	0	10	8	26	"No?  And yet getting yourself killed will hardly help the princess.  <sigh>  But I will tell you what I know."
1	0	10	9	26	"Legend has it that it is the right of any human to challenge the Lord of the Dead in order to save his own life or the life of another already passed.  But the knowledge of how to do this was lost centuries ago."
1	0	10	10	26	"I have only heard of one who tried it--a young knight who came to the Land of the Green Isles from a distant land long ago.  According to the story, he was determined to challenge the Lord of the Dead for the soul of his dead lover."
1	0	10	11	26	"It is said that he tamed the Lord of the Dead's horse, a black-winged, demon-hearted beast named Night Mare.  Night Mare sometimes flies to the human world to feed on certain noxious plants.  Those unfortunate enough to see her are glad to escape with their very souls intact!"
1	0	10	12	26	"Somehow, the knight captured Night Mare and rode off on her back, supposedly to the Realm of the Dead.  But neither the knight nor his lover ever returned.  If there was a means for challenge, it was lost with the knight."
1	0	10	13	2	"I see.  Can you tell me anything about the Lord of the Dead?"
1	0	10	14	26	"Ah, that is a blacker matter still!  To the Druids, he is Samhain, Lord of Coldness and Despair.  Samhain was once a man like you or I, but he insulted the gods and was sentenced to rule the Underworld.  Immortal he is, and mateless; robbed of sleep, robbed of movement, robbed of companionship."
1	0	10	15	26	"It is said that he hates all mortals even more for the mortality that he lost.  That is all I know."
1	0	10	16	2	"Interesting.  I shall remember."
1	0	10	17	26	"Now, look how the oak embers of our bonfire still glow hot, despite the rain.  If you're bent on your course, you'll need courage that's just as impervious to the chill."
1	0	10	18	26	"<sigh> May your luck last longer than your storm, brave one."
1	0	10	19	2	"May it indeed.  Thank you, Arch Druid."
1	0	9	1	99	Fire in the cage!
1	0	9	2	99	Alexander pulls out Beauty's old slave clothes, desperate to beat out the flames!
1	0	9	3	99	The flame is extinguished, but the clothes themselves burn to cinders.  Alexander won't be able to keep the cage from igniting for long!
1	0	9	4	99	The heat and movement must have jarred something....
1	0	9	5	99	Something that Alexander's carrying is starting to jiggle around!
1	0	9	6	99	Egad!  Something's REALLY percolating!
1	0	9	7	99	The water in Alexander's lamp is hot!  It's just about....
1	0	9	8	99	BOILING!!!!
1	0	9	9	99	Alexander feels a drop.  It starts to rain!
1	0	9	10	26	"That man is a powerful nature wizard!  By the sacred oak, let him DOWN!"
1	0	9	11	99	Later, after a short but furious thunderstorm....
1	0	7	1	99	Mercifully, Alexander passes out from the heat before the first tongues of flame ignite the wicker.
1	0	15	1	99	Alexander pulls out Beauty's old slave clothes, desperate to beat out the flames!  As he does so, a strand of Beauty's hair that had been caught in the mantle comes free of the clothes.
1	0	2	1	99	Alexander starts to feel a little warm.
1	0	3	1	99	The bottom of the cage is getting uncomfortably hot.
1	0	6	1	99	This cage is REALLY hot!
1	0	4	1	99	Alexander is getting REALLY hot!

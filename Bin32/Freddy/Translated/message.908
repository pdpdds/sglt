					Long ago, in the kingdom of Daventry, there were three magical treasures that kept the kingdom strong and prosperous:  A magic mirror that foretold the future, an enchanted shield with the power to protect from any invaders, and a treasure chest that was never empty.
0	0	5	2	99	These treasures were taken from Daventry by deception and stealth, and without them Daventry grew poor and weak.  King Edward, once a stout-hearted and vigorous ruler, had become powerless and sickly.
0	0	5	3	99	Edward had no heir, and everyone feared that chaos would result from his death.  King Edward asked his bravest knight, Sir Graham, to embark upon a quest to recover the three treasures.
0	0	5	4	99	Despite many challenges, Graham's quest was successful.  As his reward, King Edward named Sir Graham his heir and granted him the throne of Daventry.  Thus began the reign of King Graham of Daventry.
0	0	11	1	99	King's Quest II:  Romancing the Throne
					
					King Graham was a wise and kindly monarch.  With his great wisdom, and the return of the three treasures, Daventry prospered once more.  But Graham knew that he must soon marry and establish his own royal line with an heir to the throne.
0	0	11	2	99	The handsome young king searched far and wide for a bride, but no maiden captured his eye nor his longing heart.  Then, one day, King Graham saw in his magic mirror a vision of a lovely young woman held prisoner in a quartz tower.
0	0	11	3	99	The captive maiden was named Valanice, a girl both beautiful and wise.  She had been stolen from her home and taken to a far land.  Graham vowed to find her and set her free.  After a long journey with many trials, he did just that.
0	0	11	4	99	Graham asked Valanice to be his queen, and she agreed.  Thus began the royal family of King Graham and Queen Valanice of Daventry.
0	0	12	1	99	King's Quest III:  To Heir is Human
					
					Queen Valanice and King Graham soon became the parents of twins, a son and a daughter named Alexander and Rosella.  Life in Daventry was peaceful and good--for a time.  But the young prince was stolen from his cradle, and the kingdom went into years of deep mourning.
0	0	12	2	99	In a land far away lived an evil and powerful wizard named Manannan.  It was his wont to kidnap infant boys and raise them to be his slaves.  Before his slaves were full-grown and could pose a threat to the wizard's dominance, Manannan ridded himself of each in turn.
0	0	12	3	99	However, Manannan's most recent vassal, a boy he called Gwydion, was unusually bright and perceptive.  He mastered several of the wizard's spells and turned them against the tyrant to gain his freedom.  Gwydion was, of course, the kidnapped Prince Alexander.
0	0	12	4	99	After escaping Manannan, Alexander's travels brought him to Daventry--not the lovely and peaceful Daventry of days gone by, but a land devastated by a terrible affliction.  The kingdom had fallen victim to the ravages of a dreadful three-headed dragon.  The beast had burned the land all around and killed many people.
0	0	12	5	99	Alexander was able to use his newfound magical powers to destroy the dragon and rescue an intended victim--none other than Princess Rosella, his sister--from its lair.  He was taken before King Graham and Queen Valanice and the happy family was reunited.  Daventry rejoiced and prospered once more.
0	0	13	1	99	King's Quest IV:  The Perils of Rosella
					
					Shortly after Prince Alexander's return, King Graham's health began to fail.  The royal physicians were powerless to help him.  Only a magical fruit from the faraway land of Tamir could bring about a cure and restore the health of Daventry's beloved monarch.
0	0	13	2	99	Graham's daughter, Princess Rosella, set off in pursuit of this healing magic for her father.  On her journey, she performed many brave deeds, and had many great adventures.
0	0	13	3	99	Princess Rosella's astounding success as an adventurer saved her father's life, and insured the kingdom's continued well-being once more.
0	0	14	1	99	King's Quest V:  Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder
					
					But Daventry's fortune was not to continue unchallenged.  An evil wizard called Mordack, brother of the ill-fated Manannan, was plotting revenge on the royal family.
0	0	14	2	99	One day, while King Graham was out for a swim, Mordack used his evil magic to kidnap Valanice, Alexander, and Rosella--along with the entire castle of Daventry!
0	0	14	3	99	Heartbroken and driven, King Graham resumed his adventurer's cap once more in a quest to rescue his family from the dread wizard's grasp.  After traveling far, and being sorely tested, King Graham thwarted Mordack's plans and rescued his entire family.
0	0	14	4	99	In the process, Graham also released a stolen princess, Cassima, from her bondage in Mordack's castle and sent her back to her home of the Land of the Green Isles.  But NOT, that is, before Prince Alexander had become thoroughly and permanently smitten....

					King's Quest VI is the story of Prince Alexander's quest to woo Princess Cassima of the Land of the Green Isles.  This tale of true love and brave challenge is proudly presented for your enjoyment by Roberta Williams and the King's Quest team.

0	0	16	1	99	King's Quest VI is a little different from any other King's Quest you might have played--and perhaps even from ANY adventure game you've ever played!
0	0	16	2	99	We're proud of the design of this game, but you'll have to be on your toes to keep up!  This "tips section" will give you some special suggestions for success in mastering this game.
0	0	16	3	99	THERE ARE NO HINTS OR PUZZLE SOLUTIONS in this section--just playing tips--so, don't be afraid to read on.  We promise not to spoil anything.
0	0	16	4	99	PLAYING ADVENTURE GAMES WELL:
					
					To master this game, you'll need a good adventure game strategy.  Here's a few things that will help:
					
					1.  LOOK and HAND on everything.  Especially on a new screen, or when new items appear on a screen you've previously seen.  Read the text carefully.  Sometimes, you'll need to read between the lines.
0	0	16	5	99	2.  Pick up everything you find (using HAND).  There are no limits on inventory items in King's Quest VI, so the more the merrier.  If you can pick it up, you'll probably need it.
0	0	16	6	99	3.  Try to USE all of your inventory items on the puzzles you encounter in the game.  Sometimes even an error message will give you a clue as to what WILL work.
0	0	16	7	99	4.  SAVE OFTEN--especially before attempting anything unusual or possibly dangerous.  You may want to format several floppies just for this purpose so that you can have more than one directory's worth of save games.  It also helps to label your save games explicitly.  Since the order and/or timing of puzzles is often significant in King's Quest VI, save games will allow you to easily try different approaches to the puzzles--not to mention recovering from fatal encounters.
0	0	16	8	99	5.  READ AND SAVE YOUR GUIDEBOOK!!  There are a number of puzzles which can only be solved using the "Guidebook to the Land of the Green Isles," and several others where this manual will save you much frustration.
0	0	16	9	99	6.  If you get stuck on a puzzle, move on and come back later.  Often, just the key you need is somewhere you haven't yet explored.
0	0	16	10	99	7.  DRAW MAPS of the new areas you find.  Most areas of the game aren't difficult to remember without a map, but there are a few in which mapping will definitely help!
0	0	16	11	99	8.  Making friends is ALWAYS a good idea.  Prince Alexander is in a strange land.  He'll need all the help he can get.  Even when people push him away, it's a good idea to persevere.  There's always a way to win someone over.
0	0	16	12	99	9.  It's always wise to TALK to every game character until they begin repeating themselves.  It often takes more than one TALK to get all of a character's information.  Also, try TALK again if you suspect things might have changed for that character.
0	0	16	13	99	10.  Go back to areas you THINK you've completed.  Sometimes things change.
0	0	16	14	99	11.  If something, seemingly of importance, is there, there's probably a reason.  Take your cue from messages.  They will help let you know when things are most likely part of a puzzle rather than just part of the background.
0	0	16	15	99	12.  BE CAREFUL.  The Land of the Green Isles can be a dangerous place!  Watch your step, SAVE OFTEN, and don't believe everything you're told!
0	0	16	16	99	OPTIONAL PUZZLES:
					
					King's Quest VI has many puzzles and subplots which are OPTIONAL.  This means that you don't HAVE to find them, or complete them, to finish the game.  Approximately 50% of the game is optional.
0	0	16	17	99	This doesn't mean we made puzzles impossible to find.  If you keep your eyes and ears open, read the text carefully, and always pay attention to what the animation is telling you, you'll be able to find everything, never fear.
0	0	16	18	99	There are also multiple solutions to some of the puzzles--especially the more important ones.  Usually, in those cases, one solution is deemed 'better,' while one is 'easier' to find.  The solutions available to you may depend upon which branches of the story you have, and haven't, done.
0	0	16	19	99	And if you miss something the first time, you can always replay.  After all, you don't want to miss any of the great puzzles and great animation!
0	0	16	20	99	BEGINNING ADVENTURERS:
					
					If you are a new player, and feel a bit overwhelmed, you might try moving on if you come across something you don't know how to deal with.  Chances are, you may not need to solve that puzzle to see the end of the game.  You can always play the game again later, once you're more confident, and pick up the threads you may have missed.
0	0	16	21	99	Also, if you need help getting started, check out the Beginner's Walk-Thru, available from the ABOUT Button on the SYSTEMS Panel.  The walk-thru will lead you through the first few puzzles in the game.  If you are unfamiliar with Sierra's adventure game interface, you might also want to watch the "Interface Demo," available from the opening screen.
0	0	16	22	99	YOUR SCORE:
					
					Keep an eye on your score.  It is on the SYSTEMS panel.  If you think you're nearing the end of the game, and have done a ton of stuff...check your score.  If you have only 120 points out of the possible 231, chances are you've missed many things, and aren't as close to the end as you thought!
0	0	16	23	99	PUZZLE ORDER:
					
					If you missed something, you can usually go back and do it later.  King's Quest VI is a relatively 'open' world.  There are a few set rules for when things must happen, but not too many.  Did you forget to do something on an island?  Try going back--it will probably still be there.  Only when you near the very end of the game will you be unable to travel freely between the islands.
0	0	16	24	99	EVEN WHEN IT'S OVER, IT'S NOT OVER:
					
					Have you gotten all 231 points?  Good for you!  Here's something you might not have done, though.  There are TWO ways into the castle at the end of the game.  If you got ALL the points, you probably did it the more difficult way.  It's definitely worthwhile to restore your game back to an earlier point and try entering the castle another, easier, way.  You'll see totally new parts of the castle, and the castle puzzles are quite different.
0	0	16	25	99	MESSAGE CLEARING:
					
					During extensive "dialogue" scenes, clicking the right button will clear all the messages that occur before the next programmed animation.  If you've ALREADY SEEN a scene before, you may want to use this feature.  BE WARNED, however!  It is unfortunately easy to accidently clear messages the first time through.  Be careful with your right mouse button.  The first time you see any scene, study the text carefully.  There are usually clues in the dialogue that you'll need later.
0	0	16	26	99	If you think you may have accidently cleared text in a scene, it might be worthwhile to restore and watch that scene again.
0	0	16	27	99	PUZZLES EFFECT PUZZLES:
					
					You may notice things changing in the game.  For instance, perhaps you solve a certain puzzle--say the cat puzzle--and observe the results.  Later, you restore back to a point in the game before the cat puzzle.  When you do the cat puzzle again, the results are different!  Why?  Probably because you solved another puzzle--say the hat puzzle--before redoing the cat puzzle.  Sometimes WHEN you solve a puzzle effects the puzzle's outcome.  If this happens, it should be clear what order of events is preferable, and you've just gotten one step closer to mastering the game!
0	0	16	28	99	HINTS:
					
					If you get stuck, you can get help in any of the following ways:
					
					1.  Sierra can provide hints through their Sierra BBS, via mail, or through their automated 900 hint line.
0	0	16	29	99	2.  Alternately, you can purchase a hint book.  This is especially recommended once you've been through the game several times.  The hint book has information on the creation of King's Quest VI as well as all the maps, optimal walk-thrus, and explanations of how all of the sub-plots and puzzles are related.
					
					See the Game Manual that came in your King's Quest VI box for phone numbers and addresses.
0	0	17	1	99	Tips for playing King's Quest VI:
0	0	18	1	99	King's Quest VI Beginner's Walk-thru:
0	0	18	2	99	WARNING:  This section will give you solutions to the first few puzzles in the game.  Experienced players might want to avoid this section and strike out on their own, without assistance.  This walk-thru is also available separately in your King's Quest VI directory.  For instructions on printing or viewing this walk-thru from DOS, see the README file.
					
					As the game begins, Alexander has been shipwrecked on an unknown beach.
0	0	18	3	99	1)  Look at your surroundings.  Click the LOOK icon on:
					       The ocean
					       The wrecked ship in the distance
					       The sand on the beach
					       The rocks
					       The plank on the beach
0	0	18	4	99	2)  You may have noticed an odd, glinting object on the sand near the water.  LOOK at the glinting object.
0	0	18	5	99	3)  Hmmm, a ring.  Pick up the ring with HAND on ring.
0	0	18	6	99	4)  Now try HAND on various locations on the screen:
					       The ocean
					       The wrecked ship in the distance
					       The sand
					       The rocks
					       The path
					       The plank on the beach
0	0	18	7	99	5)  The plank was covering something, wasn't it?  Click LOOK at the box under the plank.  Now click HAND on the box under the plank.
0	0	18	8	99	6)  You are now viewing an INSET.  LOOK all around inside the inset.  LOOK at the glinting object in the inset.  HAND on glinting object in inset.  Note:  If you click LOOK or HAND outside the inset, the inset will erase.  Don't worry, you can always get it back again.
0	0	18	9	99	7)  Now it's time to leave the beach and figure out where Alexander has been shipwrecked.  Click the WALK cursor over the hill to the north to leave the beach.
0	0	18	10	99	8)  Alexander is now at a crossroads.  Click LOOK all around the screen.  Now try HAND.  To the left is a village--a place to explore later on your own.  Right now, Alexander is more interested in the castle to the right.  Click the WALK cursor near the castle to the right.
0	0	18	11	99	9)  Alexander is now standing in front of a castle.  Click the LOOK cursor all around the screen.  Now try HAND.
0	0	18	12	99	10)  In front of the castle doors are two odd-looking creatures--rather like dogs in uniform.  Perhaps they can tell Alexander where he is.  Click the TALK icon on the dogs.
0	0	18	13	99	11)  Aha!  Now Alexander knows where he is.  But what about getting into that castle?  Click the TALK icon on the dogs again.  And again.  In fact, it's always a good idea to use the TALK icon until the other characters begin to repeat themselves.
0	0	18	14	99	12)  Alexander wants to get inside the castle, but the guard dogs don't want to let him in.  This must be a puzzle.  Think about what the guard dogs are saying.  They don't believe Alexander is a prince.  If they did, they might let him in.  Does Alexander have any proof?
					
					Go into your inventory from the icon bar.  Select the coin you got from the box under the plank.  Click on OK on the inventory window.  Now click the COIN icon on the guard dogs and observe their response.  Try clicking the COIN on them a second time.
0	0	18	15	99	Well, that didn't work.  Now try the ring.  Select the ring and click the RING icon on the guard dogs.  Aha!  Watch the following cartoon for important story elements.
0	0	18	16	99	13)  Well, now Alexander knows a little bit about his current situation--and so do you.  Now it's time to explore the island--and beyond.  IF you can find a way off the island, that is!
					
					Good luck!

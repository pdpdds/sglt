3	0	6	1	99	There's no time to mess with that now!  That minotaur is dangerous!
3	17	6	1	99	That shield won't do much good in close combat against a minotaur!  Alexander will have to think of something else.
3	17	7	1	99	There's no more danger in the minotaur's lair.  The shield is not necessary.
12	0	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't want to do anything with that altar.
12	5	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't want to touch the hideous altar!
12	1	0	1	99	A monstrous altar towers in one corner of the room.  Alexander shudders with revulsion at the thought of the rituals performed at that sacrificial table.
12	2	0	1	99	The altar stands grimly silent.
5	0	6	1	99	Alexander won't be able to do anything for the girl until he's taken care of that minotaur!
5	0	7	1	97	!!!REMOVE THIS MESSAGE.  THIS CASE IS NOT POSSIBLE.
5	5	8	1	99	Overcome with anger, Alexander prepares to assist Lady Celeste.  But as he steps forward, she sees him....
5	5	9	1	99	Alexander won't be able to do anything for the girl until he's taken care of that minotaur.
5	1	8	1	99	A beautiful Winged One girl is struggling for her life against the minotaur.
5	1	9	1	99	The beautiful Winged One girl watches from the altar as if resigned to seeing Alexander die.
5	2	8	1	99	Alexander gallantly offers the lady his aid.
5	2	8	2	2	"Can I be of some assistance?"
5	2	8	3	99	Lady Celeste looks up at the sound of the strange voice and spots Alexander.
5	2	9	1	2	"I'll take care of the minotaur, m'lady!  Have no fear!"
10	0	0	1	99	There is no reason to do anything with the foul animal skull.
10	5	0	1	99	Alexander can't reach the animal skull.  Besides, he doesn't want to touch the foul thing.
10	1	0	1	99	The skull of some large and unknown beast guards the east exit.
9	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use anything on the doorway.  Just walk through it.
9	5	0	1	99	There's no reason to manipulate the east exit.  Just walk through it.
9	1	6	1	99	There's a doorway on the east wall of the lair.  Perhaps it's another exit from the catacombs!
9	1	7	1	99	That doorway leads to the minotaur's secret exit, the outside world, and fresh air!
4	0	8	1	99	Alexander steps forward, determined to use anything at hand to save the girl.  But before he can do anything....
4	0	9	1	99	That would have little effect on the rampaging minotaur!
4	5	8	1	99	Alexander prepares to take on the minotaur with his bare hands.  He steps forward bravely....
4	5	8	2	99	And is spotted by Lady Celeste!
4	5	9	1	99	Alexander prepares to take on the minotaur with his bare hands.
4	5	9	2	99	Hand-to-hand combat with a minotaur is, apparently, not a great idea.
4	5	9	3	2	"AAAIIEEE!!"
4	1	0	1	99	The minotaur is a huge, monstrous beast with cloven hooves and the head of a bull.
4	38	11	1	99	Alexander, his back inches from the fiery pit, tempts the minotaur with the red queen's scarf.
4	38	11	2	2	"Look here, you bully!  Nice, bright red!"
4	38	11	3	3	"<SNORT!> RRRRRED!"
4	38	11	4	97	!!!Do sound effect:  "GRROAARRRRrrrrrrr...!"
4	38	11	5	99	The minotaur drops from sight amidst the consuming flames.  Slowly, his scream fades as well.
4	38	11	6	2	"(VOICE SHAKY) Have you been harmed, Lady Celeste?  Are you all right?"
4	38	11	7	4	"(NEUTRAL, COOL VOICE)No, I am not all right!  I assume you do not intend to leave me tied up on this vile monstrosity!"
4	38	11	8	2	"(BLUSHING) Er, of course not.  Sorry."
4	38	11	9	2	"Let's see.  If you'll give me a moment, I'll have these untied in no time."
4	38	11	10	4	"<sigh> I can't wait that long.  Look, I wear a small dagger just inside my belt.  It should be enough to cut the rope."
4	38	11	11	2	"Oh.  All right, I...I've got it, Lady Celeste.  Here we go."
4	38	11	12	4	"Thank you.  You may keep the dagger as a gift for saving my life."
4	38	11	13	2	"That's very generous...."
4	38	11	14	4	"Forget it!  Do you mind if we just get out of here now?"
4	2	8	1	2	"Excuse me!  I demand the release of that maiden this instant, you fiend!"
4	2	8	2	99	Lady Celeste looks wildly around the room for the source of the strange voice and spots Alexander.
4	2	9	1	2	"Wouldn't you like to let the girl and I go?"
4	2	9	2	3	"<snort> Don't be a fool!"
6	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to put that in the pit.
6	5	0	1	99	Ouch!  That fire looks a trifle hot to warm one's hands over.
6	1	0	1	99	A pit has caved in the floor in one corner of the minotaur's lair.  Flames rise from the pit as though from the throat of a dragon trapped in the earth.  The fire makes the lair unbearably hot.
6	3	0	1	99	Alexander, apparently confused by being in the deserted minotaur's lair, missteps into the fiery pit!
6	3	0	2	2	"HHHOOOOTTTTTTTT!"
2	0	6	1	99	That won't stop the minotaur!
2	0	7	1	99	There's no reason to use that there.
2	5	6	1	99	Alexander doesn't have time to examine that now!  He's got more important things to worry about--like the minotaur!
2	5	7	1	99	Alexander doesn't want to touch anything in the minotaur's foul lair.
2	1	6	1	99	Alexander has found the minotaur's lair!  The chamber has the rank smell of a beast's den, but a strange altar testifies to the minotaur's evil intelligence.
2	1	7	1	99	The minotaur's lair, now empty, still reeks with the foul stench of the minotaur.
2	2	8	1	2	"<Ahem> Excuse me."
2	2	8	2	99	Lady Celeste looks up at the sound of the strange voice and spots Alexander.
2	2	9	1	99	Crying out for help would not do any good!
2	2	7	1	99	The minotaur's lair is now silent and empty.  There is no one here to talk to.
2	3	8	1	99	Alexander steps further into the room.
2	3	8	2	99	The movement catches Lady Celeste's eye.  She screams for help.
11	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use anything on the doorway.  Just walk through it.
11	5	0	1	99	There's no reason to manipulate the door.  Just walk through it.
11	1	0	1	99	There's a doorway leading back into the catacombs on the west wall.
11	3	8	1	97	!!!Do not print this.  Comment msg only.
11	3	7	1	97	!!!Do not print this.  Comment msg only.
13	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the skulls.
13	5	0	1	99	Alexander has no desire to take those skulls off of the grisly altar.
13	1	0	1	99	The skulls of two of the minotaur's unfortunate victims have been stuck on the altar in a gruesome fashion.
13	2	0	1	99	The victim's skulls speak their horror in silence.
1	0	1	1	4	"No!  I beg of you, please don't hurt me!"
1	0	1	2	3	"<GRRROARR> Your struggles are useless <GRRR>!"
1	0	1	3	99	It's the minotaur!  And he's struggling with a Winged Ones girl--she must be Lady Celeste!
1	0	19	1	99	The minotaur is still struggling with the Winged Ones maiden.
1	0	3	1	4	"You there!  Human!  Help me!  HELP!"
1	0	3	2	3	"<GROWL> Who dares enter my lair?"
1	0	3	3	2	"I ask you to release your captive or suffer the consequences!"
1	0	3	4	3	"<GRRRROAAARR!>  Never!  You die, human!"
1	0	3	5	99	As the minotaur advances in attack, Alexander slowly backs away....
1	0	3	6	99	Until he can back away no more!
1	0	3	7	3	"Now where to, <GROWL> little man?"
1	0	18	1	99	Lady Celeste, looking desperately around the room for any possible means of escape, suddenly spots Alexander.
1	0	5	1	3	"Now you die!"
1	0	5	2	97	!!!Do sound effect:  "Urk!"

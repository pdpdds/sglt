4	1	9	2	24	"Dear Shadrack.  Salutations from the Society of the Black Cloak, etc., etc.  My long preparations are about to come to fruition."
4	1	9	3	24	"In a matter of minutes, I will wed the lovely <hah-hah> Cassima."
4	1	9	4	24	"Once I've established my power and my crown, I can stage another 'accident.'"
4	1	9	5	24	"The princess has proven infuriatingly stubborn, as you know.  She's becoming quite a dangerous little thorn in my side."
4	1	9	6	24	"In a way, it's a shame I have to kill her--she is lovely and would be amusing to keep around, but I can't risk her talking treason to one of the guards.  So far, I've managed to keep her locked away, but I can't continue that forever."
4	1	9	7	24	"Well, on to it now.  I'd send her to you but, as you know, I had no luck in doing so with Mordack.  I close in triumph--KING Abdul Alhazred."
4	1	9	8	24	"I think it's about time to see if Shamir has taken care of the wench as I asked.  It's almost time for the wedding."
4	1	9	9	99	The vizier's words fill Alexander with blazing anger--and fear for Cassima's life.
4	1	9	10	2	"That blackguard!  That murderous swine!  He'll not have his way if I have anything to say about it!"
4	1	10	1	24	"And now to see to the final preparations.  It's almost time for the wedding.  Hee, hee!"
4	1	8	1	99	Alexander looks through the chink in the wall.
4	1	8	2	99	The vizier's study is now empty.

8	1	19	1	99	On the table is a coat of arms with the head of a beast on the crest.

4	5	5	1	99	Alexander pulls the drapery back over the table.
4	5	6	1	99	Alexander pulls the drapery aside, curious as to what might lie underneath.
4	1	4	1	2	"A.A.?  That must stand for Abdul Alhazred!"
4	1	3	1	99	The velvet drapery has been pulled back, exposing the table's items.
4	1	3	2	99	The initials A. A. are embroidered on the drapery.

5	1	7	1	99	On the table is a miniature oak tree.  It looks very old.

3	1	0	1	99	Alexander is standing in the Castle of the Crown's treasure room.  The soft-toned room seems very secure.  Along the walls are trunks and caskets--probably full of the kingdom's treasure.  In the middle of the room is a low table.
3	2	0	1	99	There's no one in the treasure room to talk to.
11	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the shield and spears.
11	5	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't need the gold shield and spears.  Besides, the soft gold wouldn't stand up well in a real battle.

7	5	18	1	99	Alexander hesitates to take the treasures on the table without learning more about them.
7	1	15	1	99	On the table is a strange-looking stone that's giving off an odd, high-pitched noise. 
7	1	15	2	2	"That must be the Isle of Wonder's singing stone.  Didn't the queens think that the Beast had stolen it?"
7	1	16	1	99	The Isle of Wonder's singing stone is perched on the table.
7	2	0	1	99	The singing stone only continues to hum and does not respond to Alexander.
14	5	0	1	99	Alexander can't reach the skylight.
14	1	0	1	99	The domed ceiling has a skylight set into it that allows beams of sunlight to enter the room.
1	0	1	1	99	As Alexander looks at the objects on the table, he realizes the depth of the vizier's cunning.  It must have been the vizier (or an accomplice) who stole that one thing most precious to each island, and then leaked rumors that one of the other islands was responsible!

12	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the trumpet.
12	5	0	1	99	Alas, the trumpet won't bring these walls tumbling down, and thus is of little use to Alexander.
12	1	0	1	99	A gracefully curled trumpet hangs on the wall.
10	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to disturb the storage trunks with that.
10	5	0	1	99	Alexander has no wish to steal from the treasury of the Land of the Green Isles.  It might be under the vizier's control now, but it still belongs to the people.
10	1	0	1	99	Those trunks probably contain the kingdom's treasure--once guarded so well and used so wisely by King Caliphim, now in the hands of that blackguard, Alhazred!
10	2	0	1	99	The storage trunks say nothing.
13	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to do that to the urn.
13	5	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't need the urns.
13	1	0	1	99	Graceful urns adorn the cool treasure room.

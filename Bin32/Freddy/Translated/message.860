6	1	0	1	99	The stairway ends here at the entrance to the upstairs hallway.
7	0	0	1	99	Alexander can't do anything with the ceiling from here.
7	5	0	1	99	Alexander can't reach the ceiling from here.
7	1	0	1	99	The ceiling features a vaulted dome that provides filtered sunlight to the upstairs hallway.
3	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the door.
3	5	0	1	99	Alexander decides to make a try for one of the doors on the east wall.
3	1	8	1	99	There are two thick wooden doors on the east wall.
3	1	9	1	99	There are two thick wooden doors on the east wall.  The doors have keyholes, but Alexander can't get close enough to look through them.
3	64	0	1	99	Alexander can't get close enough to the door to use the nail.  Besides, it might not even be locked.
3	2	0	1	99	Knocking on or calling through the doors would not be a good idea with the guard dogs on patrol.

8	0	0	1	99	Using that on the floor would accomplish nothing.
8	5	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't see anything of particular interest on the floor.
8	1	0	1	99	The floor is constructed from the same cool, beige marble that adorns the walls.  A red carpet runner brings color to the hallway and protects the ivory floor.
8	2	0	1	99	The floor underfoot has nothing new to say.
8	37	0	1	99	Alexander walks into the hallway to use the mechanical nightingale.
5	0	0	1	99	The guard dogs would probably be less interested in that than they would be in, for example, Alexander's uninvited presence in the castle.
5	13	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't need to use the mirror on the guard dogs--it is quite clear who they are.
5	42	0	1	99	The guard dogs are unlikely to sit still long enough to listen to the boring book.
5	28	0	1	99	The spell book doesn't have anything in it that would take care of that guard dog.  A "Bone of Sleep" spell would be nice, for example, but it isn't in the book.
5	7	0	1	99	The two guard dogs are unlikely candidates for bribing.
5	8	0	1	99	The small dagger would be of little assistance in overcoming those guards.
5	14	0	1	99	The guard dogs are unlikely to accept something to drink from Alexander.
5	47	0	1	99	The flower of stench, while terribly stinky, is hardly strong enough to overpower those guards.
5	15	0	1	99	The guard dogs are unlikely to believe Alexander as to the origins of that strand of hair.
5	5	0	1	99	The patrolling guards are powerfully built and well-armed.  Alexander decides not to test their natural advantages in the fighting arena.
5	61	0	1	99	The guard dogs do not have enough authority to do anything about the information in that letter.
5	1	0	1	99	Two powerfully-built guard dogs patrol the upstairs hallway.
5	1	0	2	99	The guard dogs patrol in a diverging pattern to insure constant visual coverage of all parts of the hallway.
5	32	0	1	99	
5	62	0	1	99	Those are guard DOGS, not guard CATS!  That milk is not going to get Alexander anywhere!
5	65	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't want to share that note with anyone!
5	33	0	1	99	It's doubtful that the guard dogs would believe Alexander about that ribbon's origin.
5	70	0	1	99	The guard dogs are unlikely to be impressed by an intruder's credentials.
5	71	0	1	99	The guard dogs look too tough to be moved by Alexander's sentimentality.
5	16	0	1	99	Alexander may have used the scythe on the magical rose bushes, but he is not about to hack through the guard dogs in the same manner.
5	51	0	1	99	The guard dogs probably do enjoy a good bone now and then, but NOT in the form of a human skull!
5	2	0	1	99	Alexander decides to take the direct approach with the guard dogs.
5	2	0	2	2	"Er, hello there.  Could you tell me how I might go about getting an audience with the vizier?"
5	34	0	1	99	Neither the guard dogs nor Rotten Tomato would appreciate that approach!

2	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the marble hallway.
2	5	0	1	99	Alexander sees nothing of particular interest about that area of the marble hall.
2	1	0	1	99	Alexander is standing in an upstairs hallway of the castle.  Doors on the east wall probably lead to bedrooms or storage rooms, and there's an exit to another corridor at the end of the hall.  Two guard dogs patrol the hall.
2	2	0	1	99	The hallway does not reply.

1	0	6	1	99	Whoa!  Alexander runs right into a guard dog patrol!
1	0	7	1	99	The guard dog patrol is still on duty here.
1	0	2	1	99	Uh, oh!  Company!
1	0	3	1	6	"Mite!  Look at this!"
1	0	3	2	2	"Hi.  Uh...nice castle."
1	0	3	3	7	"Cheeky, isn't he?  Grab 'im, Jowels!"
1	0	3	4	6	"I bet this is the foreigner we were told to look out for!"
1	0	3	5	6	"Well, let's lock him up and go tell Saladin.  He'll tell us what kind of fish we've caught."
1	0	3	6	6	"Right, Jowels."
10	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the urns.
10	5	0	1	99	Alexander has more urgent things to do than to try to move those heavy urns!
10	1	0	1	99	Large, glazed urns stand like sentinels in the hallway.
10	2	0	1	99	The urns say nothing.

1	0	1	1	20	"(DEMANDING) With what trickery did you master the Cliffs of Logic and reach the City of the Winged Ones?"     
1	0	1	2	2	"(FIRM AND CALM) Only the magic of clear thought, my lord.  I meant no harm."
1	0	1	3	21	"(WHISPERS TO HER HUSBAND) The Cliffs of Logic?  It is the sacred Oracle's prophecy, Azure!"  
1	0	1	4	20	"(RESTRAINED VIOLENCE) Yes, Aeriel.  Hmmm.  It is lucky for you, human, that climbing the Cliffs of Logic is part of a prophecy that I cannot ignore."   
1	0	1	5	20	"We have just been ordered by Vizier Alhazred himself to 'dispose' of any strangers that might land on our fair Isle.  But the prophecy would have a different fate befall you."   
1	0	1	6	21	"(COLD, CONDESCENDING) The prophecy predicts that whosoever climbs the Cliffs of Logic will defeat the minotaur."
1	0	1	7	21	"The minotaur has violated our sacred catacombs and eats our young in sacrifice.  Our own daughter, Lady Celeste, was taken there only this morning as his most recently demanded offering!"
1	0	1	8	20	"(FINDING HIMSELF CLEVER) A dilemma then--whom shall I obey in regards to your fate?  The Oracle or the Crown?  But since Alhazred did not dictate HOW I was to dispose of intruders, and since you cannot possibly survive the catacombs, your imprisonment there should serve both purposes quite admirably."                    
1	0	1	9	2	"(FIRM, CALM) I will not resist you in this, my lord.  I shall do my best to save your daughter."
1	0	1	10	20	"(CONDESCENDING) Hmph.  First I must tell you that the catacombs are a labyrinth of rooms, a place of exceeding danger.  You will need many tools and clear wits to survive it."
1	0	4	1	20	"(COLD, RELUCTANTLY RESPECTFUL) I see you have proven yourself the 'hero' of the prophecy.  Well, I am expected to thank you for saving my daughter's life, so I thank you."   
1	0	4	2	20	"I am obliged to thank you for the restoration of our sacred catacombs.  It means much to our people.  We have already begun the process of clearing the deadly traps from its rooms."    
1	0	4	3	20	"It is also my duty to grant you a visit with the Oracle, so this I do.  I will grant you the freedom to leave here unharmed, despite my orders to the contrary from the Crown.  But there my obligations to you end."    
1	0	4	4	20	"I have no love for Alhazred, but he is my liege, and if Princess Cassima trusts him and wishes to wed him...."   
1	0	4	5	20	"My guards will take you to the Oracle now.  When your time with her is through, I want you to leave the City of the Winged Ones and never return." 
1	0	4	6	20	"I don't know who you are or what you want here, but I will not disobey my Crown further."  
1	0	4	7	2	"(BOWING, RESPECTFUL) I thank you, Lord Azure.  I will respect your wishes."  
1	0	3	1	21	"(COLD, LOGICAL) Azure, he must be allowed time to prepare for the task--if only in the slight chance that he could actually save our Celeste."  
1	0	3	2	20	"(RELUCTANT, THREATENING) Hmmm.  Very well.  Intruder, my guards will take you to the beach.  Prophesied hero or spy, any soldier must be granted time to prepare for battle."    
1	0	3	3	20	"Be warned!  If you have the courage to actually return to the Isle of the Sacred Mountain and face your destiny, my guards will have orders to take you to the catacombs on sight."  
1	0	3	4	2	"(SERIOUS & RESPECTFUL) I understand, Lord Azure." 
1	0	3	5	21	"If by some miracle you succeed, human, the prophecy grants you a visit with the sacred Oracle.  Her powers are mighty, her vision all-seeing."     
1	0	3	6	21	"Many of our own citizens would be willing to risk certain death in the catacombs for a chance at a meeting with the Oracle.  May that thought give you the courage to return."        
1	0	3	7	2	"Oh, I will return, Lady Aeriel.  You have my word."       
1	0	2	1	2	"(SERIOUS & RESPECTFUL) I am ready."
1	0	2	2	20	"(DECISIVE) Very well.  My guards will take you there now.  You seem courageous enough, but the catacombs will determine how brave you really are."

0	0	1	1	99	You received  out of  points.  You've completed approximately   percent of the main-path puzzles in King's Quest VI.
0	0	1	2	99	We hope you'll play again!
0	0	1	3	99	Congratulations on your excellent performance!  If you want to go "beyond" the ultimate score, we recommend that you try the other, "easier" entrance to the castle.  You can do so easily by restoring back to a point just before the Druid's rain storm.  DON'T GO BACK TO SEE THE DRUIDS--instead, head for the castle.  New puzzle challenges await you!

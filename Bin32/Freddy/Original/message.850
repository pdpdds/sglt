16	1	0	1	99	The stairway ends here at the entrance to the upstairs hallway.
11	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the hallway doors.
11	5	0	1	99	Alexander will have to enter the north hallway if he wants to do anything with that door.
11	1	0	1	99	Alexander can barely make out part of a doorway in the north hallway.
15	0	0	1	99	Alexander can't do anything with the ceiling from here.
15	5	0	1	99	Alexander can't reach the ceiling from here.
15	1	0	1	99	The ceiling features a vaulted dome that provides filtered sunlight to the upstairs hallway.
4	0	0	1	99	Using that on the floor would accomplish nothing.
4	5	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't see anything of particular interest on the floor.
4	1	0	1	99	The floor is constructed from the same cool, beige marble that adorns the walls.  A red carpet runner brings color to the hallway and protects the ivory floor.
4	2	0	1	99	The floor underfoot has nothing new to say.
4	37	19	1	99	Alexander winds the mechanical nightingale and places it strategically on the floor of the upstairs hallway.
4	37	20	1	99	Alexander walks into the hallway to use the mechanical nightingale.
6	0	0	1	99	The guard dogs would probably be less interested in that than they would be in, for example, Alexander's uninvited presence in the castle.
6	0	25	1	99	The guard dogs are talking at the end of the hall, and Alexander has no desire to disturb them!
6	13	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't need to use the mirror on the guard dogs.  It is quite clear who they are and what their purpose in the hallway is.
6	42	0	1	99	The guard dog is unlikely to sit still long enough to listen to the boring book.
6	28	0	1	99	The spell book doesn't have anything in it that would take care of that guard dog.  A "Bone of Sleep" spell would be nice, for example, but it isn't in the book.
6	7	0	1	99	The two guard dogs are unlikely candidates for bribing.
6	8	0	1	99	The small dagger would be of little assistance in overcoming those guards.
6	14	0	1	99	The guard dogs are unlikely to accept a drink from Alexander.
6	47	0	1	99	The flower of stench, while terribly stinky, is hardly strong enough to overpower those guards.
6	18	0	1	99	The guard dogs are unlikely to believe Alexander as to the origins of that strand of hair.
6	5	0	1	99	The patrolling guards are powerfully built and well-armed.  Alexander decides not to test their natural advantages in the fighting arena.
6	5	25	1	99	The guard dogs are conveniently out of the way at the moment, and Alexander has no desire to disturb them!
6	61	0	1	99	The guard dogs do not have the authority to do anything about the information in that letter.
6	1	0	1	99	Two guard dogs patrol the upstairs hallway.  The guards are short but  powerfully-built, and they're equipped with strong jaws.  The two look like natural fighters, but they don't look very bright.
6	1	25	1	99	The two guard dogs are speaking in low voices at the end of the hall, as though disturbed about something.  They aren't watching the hallway at the moment.
6	32	0	1	99	The guard dogs look too tough to be moved by Alexander's sentimentality.
6	62	0	1	99	Those are guard DOGS, not guard CATS!  That milk is not going to get Alexander anywhere!
6	65	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't want to share that note with anyone!
6	33	0	1	99	It's doubtful that the guard dogs would believe Alexander about that ribbon's origin.
6	70	0	1	99	The guard dogs are unlikely to be impressed by an intruder's credentials.
6	71	0	1	99	
6	16	0	1	99	Alexander may have used the scythe on the magical rose bushes, but he is too polite to hack through the guard dogs in the same manner.
6	51	0	1	99	The guard dogs probably do enjoy a good bone now and then, but NOT in the form of a human skull!
6	2	0	1	99	Alexander decides to take the direct approach with the guard dogs.
6	2	0	2	2	"Er, hello there.  Could you tell me how I might go about getting an audience with the vizier?"
6	34	0	1	99	Neither the guard dogs nor Rotten Tomato would appreciate that approach!
6	37	0	1	99	Remembering the guard dogs' interest in Cassima's nightingale, Alexander has a thought....

8	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the pillar area.
8	5	0	1	99	Alexander could examine the alcove area more thoroughly from the other side of the pillar.
8	1	0	1	99	There's an alcove recessed into the east wall of the hallway.
8	2	0	1	99	The alcove does not reply.
3	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the marble hallway.
3	5	0	1	99	Alexander sees nothing of particular interest about that area of the marble hall.
3	1	0	1	99	Alexander is standing in the upstairs hallway of the castle.  Several doors lead off the hallway on the west wall.  On the east wall is an alcove set behind a pillar.  At the end of the hall is an exit into a north hallway.
3	1	22	1	99	The hallway is currently empty.
3	1	21	1	99	Two guard dogs are on duty in the hallway.
3	2	22	1	99	Although the guards have been cleverly dismissed, Alexander still feels it prudent to be as quiet as possible.
3	2	21	1	99	The hallway does not reply.

1	0	1	1	6	"By Cerebus' collar, but I'll be glad when this weddin' is over!  I'm gettin' mighty tired of this patrol, Bay!  It's wearied me to the bones!"
1	0	1	2	7	"I couldn't agree with you more, Wolf!  Who'd have thought we'd ever have to listen to Princess Cassima crying all day long...and be ordered to ignore it, yet?"
1	0	1	3	6	"Something sticks in my craw about the whole thing.  The vizier says that the princess is not herself, says she's half-mad with grief over her parent's death.  I can see it, the poor mite, but still...."
1	0	1	4	7	"I agree.  It seems cruel to lock her up when she's so heartbroken.  Let her out in the fresh air, I say.  It'd do her a world of good."
1	0	1	5	6	"Aye.  Well, she insisted on the mournin' period and it's up today, thank the stars!"
1	0	1	6	7	"It's too bad we couldn't find that nightingale of hers.  The vizier says she's been pining for it."
1	0	1	7	6	"Hrmph!  If I had an ounce of luck, I would have found it weeks ago.  <sigh>"
1	0	1	8	6	"Not only would it cheer up the princess, but the reward the vizier's offered for it would make me pretty happy too, dog-gone it!"
1	0	1	9	7	"Ah, well.  Our luck will definitely be out if the vizier catches us snappin' our jaws at our post."
1	0	1	10	6	"Sorry, Wolf.  I'll keep my muzzle shut."

1	0	3	1	99	Alexander steps confidently out into the upstairs hallway...and sees two guard dogs.
1	0	33	1	99	Alexander steps into the main hallway while the guards are investigating the nightingale.
1	0	9	1	6	"Hey!  Who the...?"
1	0	9	2	2	"Um.  Hello, there."
1	0	9	3	7	"Don't just stand there!  Grab 'em, Bay!"
1	0	9	4	6	"<GRRR>  It's that saboteur fellow the vizier warned us about, I'll bet!  I say we run him through right here and now!"
1	0	9	5	7	"No <woof>!  The vizier'll run YOU through if he doesn't get a chance at the prisoner.  Let's put him in the dungeon for safe keepin', then we'll go tell the Captain."
1	0	9	6	6	"Aye, Wolf.  You're right.  Let's go."
1	0	13	1	99	The guard dogs spot Alexander on their way down the stairs with the mechanical nightingale.

1	0	24	1	99	Alexander hears the guard patrol coming back up the stairs from their little excursion with the mechanical nightingale.
1	0	11	1	99	The two patrol guard dogs, returning from downstairs, walk into the hallway and see Alexander.
1	0	8	1	99	From downstairs, Alexander hears the first wafting strains of music.  Hmmm.  It's beautiful music....
1	0	8	2	99	It's wedding music!!!!!  
1	0	8	3	99	The music has attracted the guards' attention.
13	0	0	1	99	Using that on the guard dog statue would be pointless.
13	5	0	1	99	Alexander can't reach the statue.
13	1	0	1	99	A marble statue of a guard dog in full regalia adorns the top of a pillar.
13	2	0	1	8	"Woof!  Back off, rapscallion, before I run ye through with this marble sword!"
10	0	0	1	99	There's no point in using that on the door.
10	5	22	1	99	The door is locked from the inside.  There must be somebody in there.
10	5	21	1	99	Alexander decides to make a try for one of the bedroom doors.
10	5	25	1	97	!!!Do not print this.  Comment msg only.
10	1	27	1	99	A heavy wooden door leads off the hall.
10	1	27	2	99	There's a keyhole in the door.
10	1	29	1	99	Alexander decides to sneak a peek at what's hidden behind that door.
10	1	29	2	99	Alexander can see little of interest from the keyhole's vantage point.
10	1	28	1	99	Alexander wouldn't mind taking a peek through that keyhole, but it wouldn't be safe with the guard dogs around.
10	64	22	1	99	Fiddling with that door would draw attention Alexander does not need--either from the guards in the next hallway or from the person behind the door.
10	64	21	1	99	The guard dog patrol would probably not appreciate Alexander fiddling around with that door.
10	2	22	1	2	"Hello!  Anybody in there?"
10	2	22	2	99	A voice from behind the door responds.... 
10	2	22	3	24	"Go away!  I said I didn't want to be disturbed!  <mutter stupid dogs>"

19	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the urns.
19	5	0	1	99	Alexander has more urgent things to do than to try to move those heavy urns!
19	1	0	1	99	Large, glazed urns stand like sentinels in the hallway.
19	2	0	1	99	The urns say nothing.
9	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the door.
9	5	31	1	99	Alexander finds the hallway door unlocked and slips inside.

9	1	29	1	99	Alexander casually bends over the keyhole and sees....

9	1	28	1	97	!!!Do not print this!  Comment MSG only.
9	2	22	1	2	"Is anyone in there?"
9	2	22	2	99	There is no response from beyond the door.

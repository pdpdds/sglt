0	0	1	1	99	That move was slightly arrow-neous!
0	0	2	1	99	Was that the beast you could do?
0	0	3	1	99	Why do you think they call her a WIDOW?
0	0	4	1	99	Well, walked right into that one!
0	0	5	1	99	It looks like Alexander's in a bit of a stew.
0	0	6	1	99	What a riddle!  Stones of stealth!  Find a Guide, to keep your health!
0	0	7	1	99	Don't just wander, Alexander!  Let your conscience be your Guide.
0	0	8	1	99	That wasn't a very logical step!
0	0	9	1	99	Alexander never was much good at SQUASH!
0	0	10	1	99	That was a bit too hot to handle!  Alexander should have been better prepared.
0	0	11	1	99	Feeling hot and sweaty?  Try a shower!
0	0	12	1	99	Caught in the act!  Alexander's in the doghouse now!
0	0	13	1	99	Timing is everything....
0	0	14	1	99	Perhaps Alexander should have introduced himself when he had the chance!
0	0	15	1	99	From the frying pan into the fire....
0	0	16	1	99	It must have been love at first bite!
0	0	17	1	99	Riddle, fiddle, what to do?
					Somewhere sticky, there's a clue!
0	0	18	1	99	Genie, meenie, minie, moe...Alexander can't be slow! 
0	0	19	1	99	Don't be taken in by a pretty face, Alexander.
0	0	20	1	99	And then there's some land I have for sale in the death bogs of Tamir....
0	0	21	1	99	Alexander couldn't handle those currents.  That boy must be an unbelievably strong swimmer!
0	0	22	1	99	Just wanna be loved by you....
0	0	23	1	99	"Death...where is thy sting?"  Now Alexander knows....
0	0	24	1	99	Death waits for no man!
0	0	25	1	99	There's something to be said for taking the bull by the horns, Alexander!
0	0	26	1	99	Caught in the dark, Alexander?
0	0	27	1	99	Caught in a blind alley!  If only Alexander could have seen what was coming....
0	0	28	1	99	Sometimes looks ARE everything!
0	0	29	1	99	That wasn't berry smart, Alexander!
0	0	30	1	99	Too bad Alexander couldn't quiet those ghostly tears!
0	0	31	1	99	Hey, hey, what a fix!
					Bathin' in the River Styx!
0	0	32	1	99	Evidently, Saladin is a dog to be reckoned with.
0	0	33	1	99	She loves me, she loves me NOT?
0	0	34	1	99	Nothing like getting swept off your feet....
0	0	35	1	99	Guess those gnomes couldn't reach a con-SENSES!
0	0	36	1	99	Do you ever get that sinking feeling?
0	0	37	1	99	Three spikes and you're out!
0	0	38	1	99	Alexander's mother always told him to avoid bad ghouls!
0	0	39	1	99	Hey!  That's not fare!
0	0	40	1	99	Too bad Cassima's all tied up at the moment....
0	0	41	1	99	Touche!  Alexander should have been on guard.

7	0	13	1	99	Alexander sees no reason to use that on the bump on the log.
7	0	14	1	2	"Would you be interested in this, Bump-on-a-log?"
7	0	14	2	48	"No, thank you!  I have need for little unless it would be something to throw at my brother to teach him a lesson.  I don't think that would be quite appropriate."
7	0	15	1	99	
7	8	14	1	99	Alexander wouldn't mind giving Bump something to help straighten out his brother, but he doesn't want things to get violent!
7	5	13	1	99	That bump on the log does not look particularly interesting to Alexander.
7	5	14	1	99	Bump and his log are too heavy for Alexander to carry.  Besides, Bump-on-a-log is rather a homebody; the ultimate couch potato.
7	5	15	1	99	There's no reason to disturb Bump-on-a-log's peaceful nap.
7	1	13	1	99	The fallen log has a good-sized knot or bump.
7	1	14	1	99	Bump-on-a-log is glaring angrily at his brother, Stick-in-the-mud.
7	1	15	1	99	Bump-on-a-log, having reconciled (at least temporarily) with his brother, is enjoying a peaceful nap.
7	2	13	1	99	That bump on the log does not look particularly conversational to Alexander.
7	2	15	1	99	
7	2	16	1	2	"Who are you?"
7	2	16	2	48	"I'm Bump-on-a-log, and that's my brother, Stick-in-the-mud.  We've had this thing about each other ever since our childhood.  Mom always liked me best."
7	2	16	3	47	"SHE DID NOT!  That is absolutely NOT TRUE!"
7	2	16	4	48	"(CONFIDENTIALLY, TO ALEXANDER) He's a bit lazy, you see.  He's got the only swamp ooze in the swamp right next to him.  But do you think he'd move a finger to help get you some?  Hardly.  He'd try to brain you with it, more likely.  His temper's about the only thing that ever gets a workout--and that on yours truly."
7	2	16	5	47	"Oh, like YOU'VE moved at all in the last century!  Like YOU'RE Mr. Physical Activity!"
7	2	16	6	48	"<sniff> Just because I can't reach anything, he thinks he can throw gushy swamp matter at me and just say whatever he likes.  If only I could turn the tables on that heckler, he might learn some respect.  But, as you see, I am a mere bump-on-a-log and must be content with my lot."
7	2	16	7	47	"Oh, SHUT UP!  You couldn't hit the broad side of a barn even if you HAD something to throw!  Just SHUT UP!"
7	2	16	8	48	"(WHISPERS, TO ALEXANDER) You see how he is."
7	2	17	1	2	"Is there anything I can do for you, Bump-on-a-log?"
7	2	17	2	48	"There's no changing my lot in life <sigh>.  A bump-on-a-log is a defenseless creature, alas, and must put up with whatever cruelty Fate dishes out!"
7	2	26	1	2	"Is there anything I can do to make peace between you two?  You are brothers, after all."
7	2	26	2	48	"(CONFIDENTIALLY) He needs a good thrashing, I expect."
7	2	26	3	48	"(MARTYRED) However, since YOU cannot go into the swamp, nor can I fight back, he will simply have to be borne.  Such is the life of a bump-on-a-log."
7	44	13	1	99	Why would Alexander want to use the teacup on that bump on a log?
7	44	14	1	99	Bump-on-a-log can't help Alexander out with that teacup.  It's his brother that has access to the ooze.
7	44	15	1	99	Don't bother Bump with that teacup!  He's sleeping!
7	34	14	1	2	"I thought this might come in handy the next time your brother starts picking on you."
7	34	14	2	48	"(TRIUMPHANT) Ah, ha!  Finally, old Bump-on-the-log's not so defenseless, is he?"
7	34	14	3	70	"(PANICKED) Hey!  Hey!  Whaddya you doin' there?  Watch the pulp, would ya?"
7	34	14	4	47	"(AFRAID) Now, Bumpie!  Remember all I've given you!"
7	34	14	5	48	"The only thing you've ever given me is mud!  Take this!"
7	34	14	6	70	"(SCREAMING) NO!  NOT INTO THE SWAMP!"
7	34	14	7	48	"Okay!  Okay!  I give up!  Geez, SORRY!"
7	34	14	8	47	"<sniff>  Well, I guess it's not very pleasant having things thrown at you.  I'm sorry."
7	34	14	9	48	"You mean it?  Really?  Brother!"
7	34	14	10	47	"Brother!"
7	34	14	11	99	Stick-in-the-mud and Bump-on-a-log, exhausted from the battle, immediately doze off into naps.  Rotten Tomato, being equally lazy, decides to join them.
7	34	14	12	97	!!!Do yawn sound
7	34	18	1	99	What would that bump on the log want with a rotten tomato?
5	0	0	1	99	What would a dogwood tree do with that?
5	5	0	1	99	Alexander considers climbing the tree....
5	5	0	2	99	And quickly changes his mind!
5	1	0	1	99	A large tree stretches knotted limbs out over the swamp.  Part of the tree's trunk is shaped like the face of a dog.  Why, it must be a dogwood tree!
5	2	0	1	2	"My dear tree, is it true that your bark is worse than your bite?"
14	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to leave that lying about on a log.
14	5	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't have time to sit around on the log.
14	1	0	1	99	A tough old log lies to the left of the path.
14	2	0	1	99	The log itself has nothing to say.
9	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the milkweed bush.
9	5	20	1	99	Alexander already has a bottle of milk.  One is enough to carry around.
9	5	19	1	99	Alexander takes a bottle of milk from the milkweed bush.
9	5	19	2	99	Apparently, the dogwood tree doesn't like Alexander standing that close!
9	1	0	1	99	Milkweed thrives near the mucky swamp.  Small bottles filled with milk grow on it like fruit.
9	2	0	1	99	The milkweed doesn't answer.
8	0	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't want to get swamp ooze all over that!
8	5	0	1	99	If Alexander tried to pick up the swamp ooze with his hands it would only slip through his fingers.
8	43	0	1	99	According to the spell book, the swamp ooze is supposed to go in a cup.  That old lamp is nothing like a cup!
8	1	0	1	99	A glob of swamp ooze, tossed during the brotherly fight, has landed on the log.
8	51	0	1	99	Why would Alexander want to put swamp ooze in a SKULL?
8	2	0	1	99	The glob of swamp ooze has nothing to say.
8	44	0	1	99	Alexander fills the teacup with the swamp ooze.
13	1	0	1	99	
4	0	0	1	99	The willowy cats have no need for that!
4	5	0	1	99	Alexander decides to pet the soft-looking cattails. 
4	5	0	2	99	Zounds, what a racket!  So much for stirring up those cattails!  
4	1	0	1	99	A cluster of cattails flourish near the muck of the swamp.
4	2	0	1	2	"Good day, thou most feline of fronds."
3	5	0	1	99	The mucky swamp is no place for extensive hands-on exploration!
3	1	0	1	99	The Isle of Wonder swamp oozes with muck, moss, and mud.  Crickets and frogs sing an endless serenade, and the green-filtered light adds to the sense of dampness here.
3	2	0	1	99	The swamp ignores Alexander and continues its chirps, croaks, and blurps.

10	0	13	1	99	Why would Alexander want to throw that at the stick in the swamp?
10	0	14	1	2	"Would you have any interest in this, Stick-in-the-mud?"
10	0	14	2	47	"Get outta here!  What makes you think I'd want anything of YOURS!"
10	0	15	1	99	The cranky stick-in-the-mud is sleeping now and waking him up would be rather pointless.
10	5	13	1	99	Alexander can't reach the stick in the swamp.
10	5	14	1	99	Alexander can't reach the cranky stick-in-the-mud. 
10	5	15	1	99	
10	1	13	1	99	A stick is stuck in the middle of the swamp.
10	1	14	1	99	Stick-in-the-mud glares crankily at his brother, Bump-on-a-log.
10	1	15	1	99	Stick-in-the-mud has gone into a delicious snooze.
10	2	13	1	99	Alexander sees no point in trying to talk to that stick in the swamp.
10	2	15	1	99	
10	2	22	1	2	"(POLITE) Perhaps you could toss me some swamp ooze since you seem to be able to recognize it.  I can only reach this bit by the path."
10	2	22	2	47	"(SMART ALECKY)  Well, hoity-toity, look who's Mr. Want-so-much!  You think I gotta job here passing around precious swamp matter?  You should BE so lucky."
10	2	22	3	48	"(TO ALEXANDER) He's an utter waste of oxygen.  I'd save my breath if I were you."
10	2	23	1	99	Alexander isn't getting anywhere by talking to that cranky stick-in-the-mud.  The creature simply refuses to toss Alexander any swamp ooze!
10	2	27	1	2	"But really, I...."
10	2	27	2	47	"Never!  I got your swamp ooze right next to me, and THAT'S where it's gonna stay.  This swamp ooze is MINE.  Period."
10	44	13	1	99	Why would Alexander want to use that teacup on the stick in the swamp?
10	44	14	1	99	If Alexander threw the teacup at Stick-in-the-mud, he'd probably never get it back.  Stick doesn't seem too accommodating.
10	44	15	1	99	Stick wasn't too helpful about that teacup while he was awake, and he certainly wouldn't be interested in it now that he's napping.
10	34	13	1	97	!!!Do not print this.  Comment msg only.
10	34	24	1	2	"Perhaps I can help you out by throwing a rotten tomato at Stick-in-the-mud for you."
10	34	24	2	48	"Really?  <sniff> I appreciate the gesture, but the swamp is broader than it looks.  Only a native like myself would be able to hit him from here."
10	34	25	1	99	Alexander decides to throw Rotten Tomato at Stick-in-the-Mud himself.
10	34	25	2	70	"Help!  Help!  I'm melting!"
10	34	25	3	2	"Uh, oh."
10	34	25	4	47	"(SARCASTICALLY) Gee.  GREAT arm ya got there."
10	34	25	5	48	"Yeah, great arm!  You said it, Stick!"
10	34	25	6	47	"Gee, Bump, did we just agree on something?"
10	34	25	7	48	"Why...you're right, Stick, we did!"
10	34	25	8	47	"Gee!  You know, he's even more worthless than you are, Bump!  I'm sorry I'm so mean to you sometimes."
10	34	25	9	48	"You MEAN it?  Brother!"
10	34	25	10	47	"Brother!"
10	34	25	11	99	Stick-in-the-mud and Bump-on-a-log, having reconciled at Alexander's expense, fall into a lazy sleep.  Unfortunately, Alexander never did get his ooze.
6	0	0	1	99	Why would Alexander want to throw that in the swamp?
6	5	0	1	99	Yuck!  Alexander doesn't want to put his bare hands in that oozy swamp!
6	43	0	1	99	Why would Alexander want to collect swamp matter in that old LAMP?
6	1	0	1	99	A mushy swamp lies just off the path.  It doesn't look like very good swimming!
6	2	0	1	99	The swamp gurgles an inaudible reply.
6	44	12	1	99	Alexander doesn't need any more swamp ooze.
6	44	4	1	47	"(SCORNFULLY) What do you think YOU'RE doing?"
6	44	4	2	2	"(SURPRISED, NICE) You startled me!  I was just getting some swamp ooze."
6	44	4	3	47	"Well, you certainly won't get it THERE!"
6	44	4	4	48	"(TIMID) He's right, you know.  But he COULD be a little nicer about telling you.  He's not a very pleasant stick-in-the-mud."  
6	44	4	5	47	"(ANGRY) Nobody asked you!  Be quiet!"
6	44	4	6	48	"(UNDER HIS BREATH)<sigh> Oh, the trials of being a mere bump-on-a-log."
6	44	5	1	48	"(MARTYRED)<sigh> It's true.  He's right.  Extremely irritating, but right."
6	44	5	2	47	"(ANGRY) SHUT UP!  SHUT UP!  YOU WORTHLESS BUMP-ON-A-LOG!"
6	44	5	3	48	"(DRAMATICALLY) Oh, the cross that I must bear!  Would that I could but avenge this uncalled-for abuse!"
6	44	28	1	48	"(MARTYRED)<sigh> You really won't make any progress that way.  He'll hog that swamp ooze of his.  You'll never see a bit of it."
6	44	28	2	47	"(ANGRY) I'LL SHOW YOU A BIT OF IT!  I'LL KNOCK YOUR HEAD OFF WITH IT IF YOU DON'T STOP YAPPING!"
6	44	28	3	48	"(DRAMATICALLY) You see how he is."
6	44	6	1	99	Alexander already knows that's not swamp ooze.
6	44	8	1	47	"(DISDAINFUL) THAT'S not swamp ooze!  That's swamp SLUDGE!"
6	44	9	1	47	"(DISDAINFUL) THAT'S not swamp ooze!  That's swamp MUCK!"
6	44	7	1	47	"(DISDAINFUL) THAT'S not swamp ooze!  That's swamp SLIME!"
6	44	11	1	99	Alexander already knows that's not swamp ooze.
6	44	10	1	99	That part of the swamp is out of Alexander's reach.
6	34	0	1	99	Why would Alexander want to just throw Rotten Tomato into the swamp?
6	3	0	1	99	The swampy bog sinks beneath Alexander's weight.  He feels himself being sucked slowly but firmly down into the muck!
6	3	0	2	99	As the marshy water fills Alexander's mouth, he thinks that, although he'd always wanted to try a mud bath, this is hardly what he had in mind.
12	0	0	1	99	
12	5	0	1	99	Alexander can't reach the trees in the swamp.
12	1	0	1	99	The fertile swamp is dense with moss-covered trees.
11	0	0	1	99	Rotten Tomato is too far away to give something to, and he's unlikely to move any closer.
11	5	0	1	99	Alexander is quite happy to be rid of Rotten Tomato and has no desire to fetch him from the swamp.
11	1	0	1	99	Rotten Tomato seems to enjoy the smelly, mucky swamp.  He's napping next to his new partner-in-crime, Stick-in-the-mud.
11	2	0	1	2	"How are you finding your new surroundings, Rotten...er...Mr. Tomato?"
11	2	0	2	70	"Can't you see I'm snoozin'?  Ya done good.  Now go play in the street or somethin'." 
11	44	0	1	2	"I have this teacup...."
11	44	0	2	50	"Get outta my face wid that ting!

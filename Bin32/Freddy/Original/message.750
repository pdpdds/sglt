10	0	0	1	99	There's no time for that now!  Alexander is fighting for his life--and Cassima's!
10	23	0	1	99	Alexander is already doing all he can to lift the huge, heavy sword.
7	0	0	1	99	Alexander would gladly give Cassima all he owned, but he'll have to get past Alhazred first!
7	8	0	1	99	It's too late for that now!  The vizier is standing in the way!
7	5	0	1	99	Alhazred still stands between Alexander and Cassima.  Alexander cannot reach the princess unless he deals with the vizier first!
7	1	18	1	99	The courageous princess is being stalked by the outraged vizier!
7	1	17	1	99	So this is where Alhazred stashed the real Cassima during the wedding ceremony!  She struggles against her bonds, but, thankfully, doesn't seem to be harmed.
7	2	18	1	2	"Cassima, watch out!"
7	2	18	2	28	"Alexander, help!"
7	2	19	1	2	"Don't be afraid, princess."
7	2	19	2	28	"I trust you, Alexander, but please be careful!"
7	2	20	1	99	Alexander should save Cassima first and worry about wooing her later.
3	0	0	1	99	Using that on the door would serve no purpose.
3	5	0	1	99	Alexander can't get past the vizier to escape out the door!  Besides, he would never leave Cassima behind to fend for herself!
3	1	0	1	99	There's a door on the west side of the round tower.
5	0	0	1	2	"Look what I have here, Shamir!"
5	0	0	2	32	"So? <tee, hee>"
5	0	0	3	99	The genie seems unimpressed with that.
5	8	0	1	99	It would be impossible to get close enough to a genie to use a weapon on it!
5	14	0	1	99	Shamir Shamazel would be unlikely to accept something to drink from Alexander at this point!
5	5	0	1	99	Alexander can't take the genie by force--the creature would only 'poof' himself free.
5	92	0	1	2	"Shamir Shamazel!  Hold your spells!  I am your master now.  I order you to go back into your lamp."
5	92	0	2	24	"(ASTONISHED) WHAT?  How did you get my lamp!  You thief!  You...you...you....  You've ruined me!"
5	92	0	3	32	"My lamp!  Oh, thank Balhalla!  I hated working for that loathsome creature!  I already feel his nastiness leaving me!  How I've longed for a master like you!"
5	92	0	4	32	"I've got a new master!  I've got a new master!"
5	92	0	5	24	"(CHALLENGINGLY) So you are a thief as well, Alexander?  Stealing the lamp was very clever, I'll grant you that, but I am the master thief!  Face my sword, if you dare!  The man left standing shall have the lamp!"
5	92	0	6	2	"(QUIETLY ANGRY--FED UP) So shall it be, Alhazred!  I don't need the genie to deal with a coward like you!"
5	43	0	1	99	The genie has no reason to be interested in that lamp!
5	57	0	1	99	
5	58	0	1	99	
5	59	0	1	99	
5	60	0	1	99	
5	96	0	1	99	
5	56	0	1	99	That's NOT the genie's lamp, and the genie would know that immediately!
5	1	0	1	99	Alhazred's genie, Shamir Shamazel, looks like he's winding up for a huge dazzle spell--and he's aiming it at Alexander!
5	67	0	1	2	"Look what I have here, my friend.  Peppermint!  Nice fresh peppermint!"
5	67	0	2	32	"Razzle...er...Dazzle...hmmm!"
5	67	0	3	24	"(ANXIOUS, ANGRY/AFRAID) Forget the stupid peppermint!  Don't you DARE even think about it!"
5	67	0	4	32	"HMMM!  MINT!"
5	67	0	5	24	"(HALF-CRYING, HOPELESS) Oh, no!  Not now!"
5	67	0	6	32	"Tee, hee <hic>.  Tee, hee, hee."
5	67	0	7	24	"DO something, SHAMIR SHAMAZEL!  KILL HIM!!!!!!"
5	67	0	8	32	"SEND A SMALL...I MEAN A BALL OF <hic> LIGHT TO FRAZZLE!"
5	67	0	9	99	The dazzle ball goes wild!
5	67	0	10	99	It bounces erratically around the room!
5	67	0	11	32	"Uh, <hic> oh."
5	67	0	12	24	"You killed my genie!  You idiot!  Don't you know how valuable he was!  You fool!"
5	67	0	13	24	"I'll kill you myself for that outrage!"
5	67	0	14	2	"(QUIETLY ANGRY--FED UP) So shall it be, Alhazred!  I'm ready!"
5	16	0	1	99	It would be impossible to get close enough to a genie to use a weapon on it!
5	2	0	1	2	"Listen to me, Shamir!  Renounce the vizier--I know you are not really evil!"
5	2	0	2	32	"But I am a genie, and a genie has a master!  You are not the one who holds my lamp!"
4	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the huge sword on the wall!
4	5	8	1	99	In desperation, Alexander fixes upon the only weapon in sight.
4	5	8	2	2	"Zounds!  This sword must weigh a ton!"
4	5	8	3	24	"Good.  Then you shall only fail sooner, my prince!"
4	5	7	1	99	It looks like Alexander will have to deal with Shamir before he does anything else, and that sword would be rather useless against a genie!
4	1	0	1	99	A very large, ornate, ceremonial sword has been mounted on the wall.
2	5	0	1	99	There's nothing there that will help Alexander in his final battle with the vizier!
2	1	0	1	99	It seems that Alexander is to face his destiny--for good or ill--in this round room at the top of the castle's grand tower.
2	2	0	1	99	Calling to the four winds will not help Alexander in his final battle!
1	0	2	1	97	!!!Do not print this!  Comment MSG only.
1	0	3	1	5	"(WHISPERING EAGERLY TO ALEXANDER) Prince Alexander, I did it!  I swapped the lamps!  Here, quick, take it!"
1	0	3	2	2	"Bless you, Jollo!  I knew you could do it!  Now get clear, friend!"
1	0	3	3	5	"No argument there, my lord.  Good luck!"
1	0	1	1	28	"Alexander!  Be careful, Alhazred has a sword!"
1	0	1	2	24	"Shut up, wench!  SHAMIR SHAMAZEL!!!  Get in here!"
1	0	1	3	32	"Here I am, Master!"
1	0	1	4	24	"It's about time, you bumbling fool!  How could you let him follow me?"
1	0	1	5	32	"Well, there were the guard dogs, Master, and then...."
1	0	1	6	24	"NEVER MIND!!  Just kill him--kill him NOW!"
1	0	1	7	32	"<sigh> As you wish, Master."
1	0	1	8	32	"RAZZLE DAZZLE, SNAP AND SNAZZLE...."
1	0	6	1	24	"But I forget--I stalk a kitten and turn my back to a lion!  It wouldn't do to let you gather your strength again, my prince."
1	0	6	2	99	Alhazred finishes off Alexander with one swipe of his sword.
1	0	6	3	2	"(DYING) Forgive me...Cassima!"
1	0	6	4	28	"(HORRIFIED) Alexander, no!"
1	0	4	1	32	"SEND A BALL OF LIGHT TO FRAZZLE!"
1	0	4	2	99	The dazzle ball hits Alexander!
1	0	4	3	28	"(SCREAMING IN TERROR) Alexander, no!"
1	0	5	1	24	"You may have penetrated the other islands and gotten past my guard dogs and my genie, but I knew you'd never be man enough to face my sword."
1	0	5	2	28	"Alexander, watch out!"
1	0	5	3	2	"I'm...sorry...Cassima!"
9	5	0	1	99	Alexander would never take the easy way out and escape!  He couldn't leave Cassima behind at the mercy of the vizier!
9	1	0	1	99	A descending staircase leads down to a lower level of the tower.
9	3	0	1	99	
6	0	8	1	99	That would never stop Alhazred's sword!
6	0	7	1	99	First things first!  Alexander would love to deal with the vizier, but that dazzle-throwing genie is a bit more of an immediate threat!
6	28	8	1	99	Unfortunately, there's nothing in the spell book that covers black-hearted viziers!
6	8	8	1	99	That small dagger would never be a match for the vizier's sword--at least, not while the vizier is facing the dagger's bearer and can see it coming!
6	14	8	1	99	The vizier might be evil, but he's not stupid.  He would hardly consent to drink Alexander's potion!
6	5	8	1	99	Alexander's bare hands would have little chance against Alhazred's sword.
6	5	7	1	99	
6	92	0	1	99	After all the effort Jollo went through to get that lamp, Alexander would hardly want to just hand it back to the vizier!
6	43	0	1	99	The vizier has no reason to be interested in that lamp!
6	57	0	1	99	
6	58	0	1	99	
6	59	0	1	99	
6	60	0	1	99	
6	96	0	1	99	
6	56	0	1	99	The sight of that lamp might annoy the vizier, but it would otherwise accomplish very little since it is, in fact, NOT the genie's lamp.
6	1	7	1	99	Alhazred looks confident that his genie will be able to take care of the handsome young interloper once and for all!
6	1	9	1	99	Alhazred handles his sword deftly.  He looks quite enraged, and more than ready to avenge himself on the interloping prince who has ruined his dreams of glory!
6	1	10	1	99	Alhazred, blind with rage at the princess's audacity, has turned his back on Alexander and is now attacking Cassima!
6	65	0	1	99	The vizier is probably not interested in Cassima's communications with Alexander at this point!
6	67	0	1	99	The vizier is not the one with a weakness for peppermint!
6	33	0	1	99	
6	10	8	1	99	Throwing the spoiled egg at the vizier would probably annoy him, but it wouldn't stop him!
6	16	8	1	99	That clumsy scythe would be no match for Alhazred's sword!
6	23	10	1	99	The vizier, distracted so well by Cassima's bravery, fails to watch the sword at his back--or the enraged prince who wields it!
6	23	10	2	2	"Leave her alone, Alhazred!  You are through harming her--and this kingdom!"
6	23	10	3	24	"Wha...?"
6	23	10	4	2	"Cassima!  Are you all right?"
6	23	10	5	28	"I'm fine, Alexander.  I just was so afraid for you!"
6	23	10	6	2	"There's no need to fear anymore, princess."
6	23	10	7	28	"Yes.  I know.  How can I ever repay you?  For myself, for my kingdom...."
6	23	10	8	2	"It was not in me to let harm come to you.  Can you find it in you, princess, to give me more than your gratitude?"
6	23	10	9	28	"Alexander!  What are you saying?"
6	23	10	10	2	"I love you, Cassima.  Would you ever consider...do you think you could...marry me?"
6	23	10	11	28	"Could you ever have doubted it, my prince?"
6	23	15	1	24	"SO!  The mouse would bite?"
6	23	15	2	2	"This mouse SHALL bite, as you shall soon see--or should I say, soon feel?"
6	23	15	3	24	"Hah!  You can barely lift that sword, my 'prince!'  Better to lay it down now.  I promise to dispatch you with little pain."
6	23	15	4	2	"A tempting offer, but I think I'll wait and see what this sword can do."
6	23	15	5	24	"Suit yourself."
6	23	15	6	99	Alexander's arms start to tremble under the effort of wielding the huge sword.  His muscles are nearing exhaustion.
6	23	15	7	24	"Hah!  And so it ends!"
6	23	15	8	28	"Not if I can help it, you murderer!"
6	23	15	9	99	Cassima thrusts the small dagger into Alhazred's shoulder with all her might!
6	23	15	10	24	"Yyeeiii!!!"
6	23	15	11	24	"You!  You dare raise a finger to me?!  You will regret that, princess!"
6	23	16	1	99	The vizier takes advantage of Alexander's exhaustion.  He thrusts his sword deep into Alexander's chest.
6	23	16	2	2	"Cassima!  Forgive me!"
6	23	16	3	28	"ALEXANDER!  NO!"
6	2	11	1	2	"Think of what you do, villain!  You will pay for your crimes!"
6	2	11	2	24	"The only one who will pay is YOU, for what you've done to my plans!  This I assure you, my prince!"
6	2	12	1	99	There is no point in reasoning with that black-hearted devil!
6	2	13	1	2	"If you release the princess, I will guarantee you a fair trial for your crimes."
6	2	13	2	24	"Hah!  And I guarantee that immense amounts of pain will very shortly consume you!"
6	2	14	1	2	"Won't you reconsider and surrender?"
6	2	14	2	24	"Hold your tongue and fight, you coward!"
8	0	0	1	99	Using that on the windows won't help anything!
8	5	0	1	99	Alexander can't escape out the window!  Besides, he would never leave Cassima behind with the vizier!
8	1	0	1	99	Long, peaked windows overlook the isle and the sea below.  Unfortunately, Alexander's in no position to appreciate the view!

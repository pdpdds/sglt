1	0	3	2	28	"This is no mere bit of paper, but words of love!  Who sent this?  It must have been Abdul!  Oh, Sing Sing, will he never give up?"
1	0	3	3	28	"You must be careful, pretty bird!  Stay away from Abdul!  I don't trust him so close to you.  Now, go!"
1	0	2	1	28	"Sing Sing, my sweet, you bring another present!  Let me see!"
1	0	2	2	28	"It's a poem, Sing Sing!"
1	0	2	3	99	"What was it when I looked at you?
					What power has chained me through and 
					  through?
					And binds my heart with links so tight,
					I cannot live without the sight
					  of you...."
1	0	2	4	28	"Oh, AlexANder!"
1	0	2	5	28	"I was hoping he'd return to you!  Take this to him while he waits!  Hurry, my fleet one!"
1	0	7	1	28	"I was hoping he'd return to you.  Take this to him, my fleet one, then find some new place to hide!  It isn't safe for him to be seen with you, however precious his messages!  Now, go!"   
1	0	1	1	28	"(SWEET BUT SAD) Sing Sing!  What have you got in your mouth, my pretty?"
1	0	1	2	28	"(CONFUSED, SHOCKED, THEN EXCITED) A gold ring?  Sing Sing, where did you get this?  'Realm of Daventry....?'  But, this is Alexander's ring!  Oh, my soul, he must be here!"
1	0	1	3	28	"(EXCITED, WISHFUL) Sing Sing, I wish you could tell me what you've seen!  Is he really here, then; on this very island?  Oh, if only I could leave this castle as easily as you!"
1	0	1	4	28	"(EXCITED, BUT WORRIED) Take this ribbon, Sing Sing.  If you know where he is, return it to him!"
1	0	1	5	28	"(WORRIED, WHISPERING) Please be careful, Alexander.  It is so dangerous, and yet...I could not wish you away."
1	0	8	1	28	"(SAD, WORRIED) Once you've delivered the ribbon, find a new place to hide.  I don't want Alexander endangered any more than he already is.  If Alexander is seen with you, Abdul will surely take revenge!"  
1	0	5	1	28	"Who sent this rose so white?  It must have been Abdul!  I'm surprised it did not wither and blacken in his hand!  Confound it, will he never give up?"
1	0	6	1	28	"A love poem and now a rose!  Sing Sing, I told you to stay away from the vizier!  He's as likely to give you arsenic as these unwanted tokens!"
1	0	4	1	28	"A white rose, how beautiful!  It must be from Alexander!  How I wish that I could see him with my own eyes, but Abdul will never allow it!"
1	0	4	2	28	"He only risks capture by sending me these things, dear to my heart though they are.  Fly elsewhere, my pretty friend.  Do not endanger Prince Alexander again by taking tokens from his hand!"
1	0	4	3	28	"Forgive me, Alexander...and forget me.  I cannot return your love, for I fear that I shall never leave this castle again!" 
1	0	9	1	28	"Be careful, Sing Sing!  Do not allow anyone to see you with Alexander!"

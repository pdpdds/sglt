25	0	0	1	99	There's no point in doing that to the chandelier.
25	5	0	1	99	Alexander can't reach the chandelier.
25	1	0	1	99	A candle-lit chandelier lends a soft light to the bedroom.
25	2	0	1	99	The chandelier has no glowing retorts.
24	0	0	1	99	Why would Alexander want to use that on the cushion?
24	5	0	1	99	There's nothing under the cushion but the floor.
24	1	0	1	99	A large, soft cushion has been strategically placed on the cold marble floor to provide a comfy seat near the fire.

14	5	0	1	99	Alexander opens the ebony box and looks inside.
14	1	0	1	99	There's a box of ebony on the table.
14	2	0	1	99	The box has nothing to say.

15	5	0	1	99	The box's owner would probably notice it was missing.  Besides, Alexander can't think of a use for a box of trinkets.
15	1	0	1	99	The box contains various trinkets and a scrap of paper with a word written on it.

16	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the old brush.
16	5	0	1	99	The brush is old and small.  Alexander isn't interested in taking it.
16	1	0	1	99	A worn old brush is among the box's trinkets.
16	2	0	1	99	The brush says nothing.
17	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the dice.
17	5	0	1	99	Finding Cassima is no game of chance!
17	1	0	1	99	Some old ivory dice have been left in the box.
17	2	0	1	99	CLACK!
18	0	0	1	99	It's pointless to use that on the ink.
18	5	0	1	99	The bottle contains only a small amount of black ink--most of it dried at the bottom.  Alexander decides to leave it there.
18	1	0	1	99	There's an old bottle of black ink among the box's trinkets.
18	2	0	1	99	The ink says nothing.
19	0	0	1	99	The paper would not benefit from that.
19	5	0	1	99	Alexander can read the piece of paper without taking it.
19	1	0	1	99	Inside the ebony box is a piece of paper with the word "ZEBU" printed on it.
19	1	0	2	2	"Hmmm.  Interesting."
19	2	0	1	99	Paper is not a verbal medium.
23	0	0	1	99	Ah, to consume all our earthly possessions in flame!
23	5	0	1	99	What?  And burn a perfectly good hand?
23	1	0	1	99	A fire in a small hearth warms the bedroom.
23	2	0	1	99	SNAP!  CRACKLE!  POP!

3	5	0	1	99	Alexander sees nothing of interest in that part of the bedroom.
3	1	5	1	99	Alexander is standing in an opulent bedroom that he believes--based on the contents of the trunk--must belong to the vizier.  Knowing whose room it is makes Alexander feel even more ill-at-ease.
3	1	4	1	99	Alexander is standing in a masculine bedroom.  Polished marble walls rise to meet a tall ceiling, and the furnishings have an opulent feeling.  He wonders whose bedroom this is.
3	2	0	1	99	There's no one in the bedroom to talk to.
22	5	0	1	99	The rug is too heavy to lift.
22	1	0	1	99	A square, red patterned rug helps protect bare feet from the cold marble floor.

1	0	3	2	6	"Wait a minute, Bay, while I check around in here like Captain...."
1	0	3	3	6	"HEY!  There IS an intruder in the castle!  Quick, Wolf!"
1	0	3	4	99	Uh, oh!  Caught in the act!
20	5	0	1	99	There's nothing of interest about that part of the small table.
20	1	0	1	99	A small wooden table graces the wall near the fireplace.  On the table is a box made of ebony.

6	5	0	1	99	The books look interesting, but the castle is not a good place to relax and read.
6	61	0	1	97	!!!Do not print this.  Comment msg only.
6	1	0	1	99	A few worn leather books occupy the trunk.  The top one is entitled "Guidebook to the Land of the Green Isles."
6	1	0	2	99	A book like that might have been a big help when Alexander first arrived!  The trunk's owner obviously found it interesting too, for the guidebook is dog-eared and stained.

5	5	6	1	99	Alexander picks up the most recent letter and examines it.
5	5	6	2	99	The letter is addressed to Abdul Alhazred from the Wizard Shadrack.  It reads:
5	5	6	3	99	"Greetings to a brother of the Black Cloak.  I was sorry to hear of great Mordack's death, though he was a bit of a ninny at chess."
5	5	6	4	99	"It seems the plans for that little kingdom of yours are coming along.  I must congratulate you on your handling of the king and queen.  Isolating the islands so that no protest could develop was another brilliant stroke."
5	5	6	5	99	"It looks like there's not much left to stand in your way.  Do as I recommended with the girl, and you shall have your crown."
5	5	6	6	2	"That fiend!"
5	5	7	1	99	There's undoubtedly more unnerving information in those letters, but Alexander has already seen enough!
5	61	0	1	97	!!!Do not print this.  Comment msg only.
5	1	6	1	99	It looks like the owner of this trunk is quite the correspondent.  The stack of letters appears to be ordered by the date, because the top one is dated only a month ago.
5	1	7	1	99	The rest of the vizier's letters, probably equally as disgusting, remain in the trunk.
5	2	0	1	99	The trunk may speak, but only to those with eyes to see.

4	1	0	1	99	A storage trunk sits at the foot of the bed.  The trunk bears a large brass lock.
4	64	13	1	99	Alexander wiggles the nail in the trunk's lock until he hears a click.
4	64	13	2	99	Alexander opens the trunk.

12	0	0	1	99	Why do that with the wardrobe?
12	5	8	1	99	The wardrobe is full of black cloaks and a rather sour smell.  Alexander examines the clothes, but finds nothing of interest.
12	5	9	1	99	Alexander crawls back through the wardrobe to reach the secret passage.
12	1	0	1	99	A wardrobe stands against the west wall of the room.
12	2	0	1	99	The wardrobe is cloaked in silence.

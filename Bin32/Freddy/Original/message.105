3	0	0	2	99	Hours pass....
1	0	0	1	99	Long ago, in the castle of a kingdom called Daventry....
1	0	0	2	12	"Alexander!  Here you are!  You're still not thinking about Cassima, are you?"
1	0	0	3	2	"Hmmm?  I suppose I am."
1	0	0	4	12	"Son, it's been MONTHS.  You've GOT to pull yourself together.  After all, you only met her that once...."
1	0	0	5	2	"I know."
1	0	0	6	12	"Have you discovered anything about the Land of the Green Isles?"
1	0	0	7	2	"No!  No one's even heard of it!  It's like she's just vanished!"
1	0	0	8	12	"I wish I could help.  Please try to think about something else, dear."
1	0	0	9	2	"I'll try, Mother."
1	0	0	10	28	"Alexander....  I feel so alone.  I don't know what to do....  Alexander, I wish you were here...."
1	0	0	11	2	"Cassima!  Wait!"
1	0	0	12	2	"MOTHER!  MOTHER, COME QUICK!"
1	0	0	13	12	"Alexander, what on earth?  You're white as a ghost!"
1	0	0	14	2	"Mother, I saw Cassima!  She was in the mirror!"
1	0	0	15	12	"In the mirror?  The magic mirror?"
1	0	0	16	2	"Yes!  And it showed me how to find her!"
1	0	0	17	12	"How?"
1	0	0	18	2	"The stars!  I saw the stars outside her window!  I can navigate by the stars!"
1	0	0	19	12	"Oh, Alexander....  If you really go...."
1	0	0	20	2	"It will be alright, Mother.  I promise."
1	0	0	21	99	Three long months Prince Alexander sailed the known seas...and beyond.
1	0	0	22	2	"Land ho!  LAND HO!  LAND HO!"
1	0	0	23	99	As the ship nears the shore, day turns to night and the sea turns violent....
2	0	0	1	99	Long ago, in the castle of a kingdom called Daventry....
2	0	0	2	99	A young prince sits alone in the throne room, head in hands, lost in melancholy.
2	0	0	3	99	His mother, Queen Valanice, enters, and hastens to his side.
2	0	0	4	12	"Alexander!  Here you are!  You're still not thinking about Cassima, are you?"
2	0	0	5	2	"Hmmm?  I suppose I am."
2	0	0	6	12	"Son, it's been MONTHS.  You've GOT to pull yourself together.  After all, you only met her that once...."
2	0	0	7	2	"I know."
2	0	0	8	12	"Have you discovered anything about the Land of the Green Isles?"
2	0	0	9	2	"No!  No one's even heard of it!  It's like she's just vanished!"
2	0	0	10	12	"I wish I could help.  Please try to think about something else, dear."
2	0	0	11	2	"I'll try, Mother."
2	0	0	12	99	With a feeling of helplessness, the Queen turns and leaves her son to his thoughts.
2	0	0	13	99	Suddenly, the magic mirror on the wall flashes to life....
2	0	0	14	99	The prince leaps to his feet and runs to place his hand against the shimmering glass.
2	0	0	15	99	Beneath his fingers, the mirror dissolves into a scene of a beautiful girl in a tower's window, looking out on a starry night sky.  It is Cassima!
2	0	0	16	28	"Alexander....  I feel so alone.  I don't know what to do....  Alexander, I wish you were here...."
2	0	0	17	99	The picture fades to glass, the princess to the prince's own reflection.
2	0	0	18	2	"Cassima!  Wait!"
2	0	0	19	99	But the image is gone!  Prince Alexander turns towards the throne room doors.
2	0	0	20	2	"MOTHER!  MOTHER, COME QUICK!"
2	0	0	21	99	Queen Valanice rushes in, her face full of concern.
2	0	0	22	12	"Alexander, what on earth?  You're white as a ghost!"
2	0	0	23	2	"Mother, I saw Cassima!  She was in the mirror!"
2	0	0	24	12	"In the mirror?  The magic mirror?"
2	0	0	25	2	"Yes!  And it showed me how to find her!"
2	0	0	26	12	"How?"
2	0	0	27	2	"The stars!  I saw the stars outside her window!  I can navigate by the stars!"
2	0	2	1	12	"Oh, Alexander....  If you really go...."
2	0	2	2	2	"It will be alright, Mother.  I promise."
2	0	2	3	99	And so, the prince leaves his homeland, bound for a land he knows only by the stars.
2	0	2	4	99	Three long months Prince Alexander sails the known seas...and beyond.
2	0	2	5	99	Until finally, on a day like every other day at sea, as the young prince searches through his spyglass.
2	0	2	6	99	He sights land!
2	0	2	7	2	"Land ho!  LAND HO!  LAND HO!"
2	0	2	8	99	Eagerly, the ship bounds towards the distant shore.
2	0	2	9	99	Day turns to night and the ship nears the shore.  As the sky blackens, so too, does the sea.  The ship is tossed amidst monstrous currents and whirlpools, as though the land itself were shoving the vessel away.
2	0	2	10	99	The battle is courageous, but the ship, and the prince, are drawn down and down....
2	0	2	11	99	Down into the sea....

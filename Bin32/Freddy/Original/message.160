8	5	0	1	99	The priest can do nothing to aid Alexander.
8	1	0	1	99	The old priest does not appear to be too upset by this interruption to his ceremony!  Perhaps he also dislikes Alhazred.

3	5	0	1	99	There's no time for that now!  Cassima is getting married, and Alexander's life is in danger!
3	1	0	1	99	Before Alexander's very eyes, Cassima is being wed to that blackguard, Alhazred!
3	2	0	1	99	Calling out in frustration won't bring Cassima to her senses or stop this wedding!
5	0	0	1	99	That will not sway Captain Saladin from his orders to kill Alexander!
5	28	0	1	99	There's nothing in that spell book that would belay the Captain of the Guard's sword!
5	8	0	1	99	
5	14	0	1	99	Saladin would hardly agree to drink Alexander's potion right now.
5	18	0	1	99	Saladin is unlikely to see that small token of esteem as being enough to contradict the living Cassima.
5	5	0	1	99	Alexander's bare hands would be no match for the powerful guard dog's sword.
5	1	0	1	99	Saladin looks grim as he prepares to implement Princess Cassima's wishes.
5	65	0	1	99	Saladin is unlikely to regard Cassima's prior love letter as having more authority than the living princess.
5	33	0	1	99	
5	70	0	1	99	Saladin already knows who Alexander is, and the guard dog is unlikely to be swayed by the offer of a insignia ring!

5	2	0	1	2	"I don't understand what has come over the princess, but surely she cannot mean what she says!"
5	2	0	2	13	"Beg me not.  My orders have been plainly stated.  I have no choice."
1	0	2	1	99	Just as Saladin prepares to run Alexander through with his sword, a shout is heard from the direction of the grand hall....
1	0	2	2	11	"HOLD!  In the name of the true king!"
1	0	1	1	24	"(TO ALEXANDER) Prince Alexander, here?  This is an outrage!"
1	0	1	2	24	"(TO SALADIN) How dare you allow this traitor to get past you, Saladin!  You stupid mutt!  Can't you even keep the castle free of assassins during your own princess's wedding?  Kill him!  Kill him now!"
1	0	1	3	13	"<Grrr>Lord Alhazred....  With all due respect, you are not quite king yet.  And this IS a wedding ceremony, not an execution."
1	0	1	4	24	"What?  How dare you contradict me, you flea-bitten mongrel?  I gave a direct order.  Obey me or feel my wrath!"
1	0	1	5	13	"(TO CASSIMA) M'lady, I apologize for my behavior, but I am yours to command in all things.  I wanted merely to hear your own wishes from your own lips."
1	0	1	6	13	"Tell me what is it that you wish me to do with this young man, and I will obey."
1	0	1	7	28	"Why Captain, you heard my dear Abdul.  If he wishes this atrocious young man's death, then I want nothing more than to see him get his wish.  Obey thy liege now and always."
1	0	1	8	13	"(VERY SAD AND RESIGNED) As you wish, princess."
1	0	1	9	13	"(GRIMLY, RESIGNED) The princess has spoken.  Prepare to die."
7	0	0	1	99	Alhazred is interested only in ridding himself of the youthful, and threatening, Alexander.
7	28	0	1	99	Alhazred is not interested in Alexander's pitifully inadequate spell book, and there's no spell in there for murdering blackguards!
7	8	0	1	99	Alexander is not in a position to attack anyone, with Saladin's sword only inches away!
7	14	0	1	99	Alhazred would hardly agree to drink Alexander's potion right now.
7	18	0	1	99	
7	5	0	1	99	Alexander does, indeed, feel like throttling the murdering Alhazred.  But Saladin would undoubtedly kill Alexander long before he reached the vizier.
7	43	0	1	2	
7	43	0	2	24	"Hah!  You fool!  Do you think to threaten me with that pitiful old lamp?"
7	43	4	1	2	"I have this lamp, Alhazred...."
7	57	0	1	2	
7	57	0	2	24	"Hah!  You fool!  Do you think to threaten me with that cheap new lamp?"

7	56	0	2	24	"(SCARED, ANGRY) What?  How did you get that, you thief?"
7	56	0	3	28	"(CONCERNED, HASTY--STILL GENIE) Never mind, Alhazred!  That lamp means nothing--it is a fake!"
7	56	0	4	24	"(ANGRIER THAN EVER) Blast it!  Kill the devil quick, before I do it myself!"
7	1	0	1	99	The vizier's eyes glitter with hard triumph as he prepares to watch his rival die.
7	65	0	1	99	At this point, it hardly matters to the vizier what correspondences Alexander might have had with Cassima.  After all, the rivalry between the vizier and the prince is about to be terminated.
7	33	0	1	99	
7	16	0	1	99	
7	2	0	1	2	"You fiend!  What spell have you wrought over my Cassima to make her behave so?"
7	2	0	2	24	"The princess only speaks her mind, young fool!  What makes you think she would ever prefer YOU to ME?"
4	0	0	1	99	That won't make Cassima come to her senses and change her mind!
4	13	0	1	2	"Look into this mirror, 'my love,' and show us your true heart!"
4	13	0	2	32	"AIEEE!  That mirror!  NO!!!"
4	28	0	1	99	There's nothing in that spell book that will make Cassima 'change' her mind now!
4	8	0	1	99	
4	93	0	1	99	It would probably be a little difficult to convince Cassima to drink that potion right now!
4	47	0	1	99	Making Cassima smell that horrible flower is hardly going to change her orders to Saladin!
4	18	0	1	99	Cassima doesn't seem to care whether Alexander lives or dies right now.  She is, therefore, probably not interested in anything she might have sent him through Sing Sing.
4	5	0	1	99	Saladin's sword would stop Alexander long before he could ever grab Cassima.
4	43	0	1	2	
4	43	0	2	28	"(NASTY/GENIE) And a poor-looking one it is, too!  Why should I care about that old thing?"
4	43	4	1	2	"I have this lamp, 'princess.'"
4	57	0	1	2	
4	57	0	2	28	"(NASTY/GENIE) What an awful-looking lamp!  I'm afraid I have no interest in it, whatsoever."

4	56	0	3	28	"(CONFUSED, THEN ANGRY) Wait a minute!  That's not...er, never mind.  Kill him, Saladin!"
4	1	0	1	99	Alexander is horrified by the expression of malignant glee distorting Cassima's beautiful face.  Could his wishful heart have been wrong about her all along?
4	32	0	1	99	Cassima has just ordered Alexander's death!  She's probably not in the mood to hear a love poem right now!
4	12	0	1	99	Cassima is not the one in need of a speedy exit right now.
4	65	0	1	99	
4	66	0	1	99	It is probably a little late to be wooing Cassima with precious gems!
4	67	0	1	2	"Perhaps the princess would care for some delicious peppermint leaves?"
4	33	0	1	99	
4	70	0	1	99	Cassima is obviously not interested in wearing Alexander's ring, since she has just ordered his death!
4	71	0	1	99	It is probably a little late to be wooing Cassima with flowers!
4	16	0	1	99	
4	2	0	1	2	"(HORRIFIED, HURT) Cassima, what are you saying?"
4	2	0	2	28	"(NASTY/GENIE) Silence his tongue!  His voice offends me!"
4	2	0	3	13	"Yes, princess."
4	24	0	1	99	The Oracle's sacred water might or might not produce an interesting effect on Cassima, but it is doubtful that Alexander could get her to drink it just now!

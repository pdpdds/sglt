1	0	2	1	29	"Master!  I was 'obsermving' <hic> in the village as you wished, and I saw a manger...no, a danger...no, a STRANGER there!  He says <hic> he's Prince Blamentander of Smaventry."
1	0	2	2	24	"You fool!  You've been eating those mints again!  I ordered you to stop that!"
1	0	2	3	29	"(HUMBLE)Yes, <hic> Master."
1	0	2	4	24	"Now WHO did this stranger say he was?"
1	0	2	5	29	"Prince Salamander of Pagentry, I <hic> think."
1	0	2	6	24	"You idiot!  Are you trying to tell me that Prince Alexander of Daventry is here?!"
1	0	2	7	24	"Confound it!  That's the young man Cassima met at Mordack's castle!  The timing could not be worse.  Tell me, what is he doing?"
1	0	2	8	29	"He was in the pawn shop buying a magic <hic> smap."
1	0	2	9	24	"Magic smap?  What is this magic smap?"
1	0	2	10	29	"With the smap he can travel to the other islands, Master."
1	0	2	11	24	"That's a MAP, you dolt!  Drat it all, I thought I took care of the only means of travel!"
1	0	2	12	24	"By my scimitar, I can't have him stirring things up!  Not now!"
1	0	2	13	24	"Get a hold of yourself and listen carefully, Shamir!  Go to the other islands and tell them...."
1	0	1	1	29	"(DRUNK) Master!  <hic> I followed Prince Alexander as you <hic> wished.  From the pawn shop owner he just obstained...uh...just reprieved <hic>....  He just got a magic map."
1	0	1	2	24	"(IMPATIENT) You fool!  You've been eating those mints again!  I ordered you to stop that!"
1	0	1	3	29	"(HUMBLE) Yes, <hic> Master."
1	0	1	4	24	"Now what is this about a magic map?"
1	0	1	5	29	"With the map, Prince Alexander can travel anywhere as bickly <hic> uh...quickly as I can."
1	0	1	6	24	"(ANGRY) What?  I thought I took care of the only means of travel!  By my scimitar, I can't have him stirring things up now!"
1	0	1	7	24	"Get a hold of yourself and listen carefully, Shamir!  Go to the other islands and tell them...."
1	0	3	1	24	"(IRRITATED, SURPRISED) I TOLD you not to pop in like that!  You can learn to knock like everybody else!"
1	0	3	2	29	"(EVILLY GLEEFUL) Sorry, Master, I couldn't help myself!  I have great news!"
1	0	3	3	24	"Well?  What is it?"
1	0	3	4	29	"Prince Alexander is dead!  He killed himself in despair over losing Cassima.  Tee, hee!"
1	0	3	5	24	"What?  Are you positive?  That young man has proven to be MOST devious."
1	0	3	6	29	"I saw the whole thing myself, Master.  He was really and truly quite dead!"
1	0	3	7	24	"Hmmm.  If what you say is true, it shall be most convenient.  You've spent enough time on that little irritant.  We must start thinking about the wedding."
1	0	3	8	29	"Anything, Master!  Ooh, I do love weddings!"
1	0	3	9	24	"(SMILING) Well, we do want you to look your 'prettiest,' don't we?"
1	0	3	10	24	"Now, Shamir Shamazel, to the lamp with you!  Prepare yourself, as we discussed."
1	0	4	1	99	Seconds later, in the castle....

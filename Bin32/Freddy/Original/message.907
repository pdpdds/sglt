34	13	0	1	99	There's no point in using an object on itself.
34	5	0	1	99	Alexander examines Beast's mirror.  The glass has a startling clarity, and the frame is quite beautiful.
34	1	0	1	99	Beast's mirror consists of a piece of glass set into a decorative frame.  The glass is unusually clear and the image particularly true.
34	2	0	1	99	The mirror's only reflection is in its glass.
1	0	0	1	99	It wouldn't be worthwhile to try and spice up the book by doing that.

1	5	0	1	99	Alexander opens the bargain book and reads a paragraph at random.
1	5	0	2	99	Two dulcimas raised to the degree of 40 halfdulcimas, divided into equal parts by the third of a cackle of grouse geese, put over the result of ten finemackels (albeit small finemackels), stretched over the total of....

1	5	0	4	99	Phew!  What an incredibly boring book!  No wonder the book shop owner wanted to get rid of it so badly.
1	1	0	1	99	Alexander is carrying a book from the bargain table in the book shop.

2	5	0	1	99	Alexander opens the rare book and looks inside.
2	5	0	2	99	Alexander glances at the riddles in the book, but is more interested in the missing page.  He hopes the book shop owner won't mind.
2	1	0	1	99	Alexander is carrying a 'rare' book from the bookworm.  The words on the binding are very faint; "The <something> <something> Riddle Book."

4	39	0	1	99	
4	5	0	1	99	The brick feels very heavy and solid in Alexander's hand.
4	1	0	1	99	Small speckles of sand stand out against the otherwise gray brick.
5	0	1	1	99	The clean paintbrush leaves no imprint on that.
5	0	2	1	99	The paint has dried on the tip of the brush and leaves no impression behind.
5	28	1	1	99	The spell book would be useless on a clean paint brush!
5	28	2	1	99	The "Make Paint Spell" must be used on the object Alexander painted, not on the dirty paint brush.
5	29	0	1	99	
5	5	1	1	99	The paint brush bristles have softened to a perfect consistency after much hard use.
5	5	2	1	99	The paint has already dried on the tip of the brush and is now useless.
5	1	1	1	99	Alexander is carrying a clean, but well-used, painter's brush.

6	5	36	1	99	Alexander searches through Beauty's clothes and finds a long strand of blond hair.
6	5	34	1	99	Alexander searches through Beauty's clothes but finds nothing. 
6	1	0	1	99	Beauty's old clothes are very ragged and heavy.  They consist of a long, thick dress, and a headpiece which covers the hair and most of the face.   
6	1	36	1	99	A long strand of Beauty's blond hair is caught in the mantle.
7	0	0	1	99	It's not necessary to use that on the coal.
7	46	0	1	99	
7	5	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't want to get his hands dirty by playing with that coal.
7	1	0	1	99	Alexander has a pitch black lump of coal that he found on the Isle of the Mists.
8	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the coin of Daventry.
8	40	0	1	99	
8	5	0	1	99	Alexander rubs his fingers over the indentation of King Graham's face on the copper coin, and thinks fondly of home.
8	1	0	1	99	Alexander is carrying a copper coin of Daventry.  King Graham graces the front of the coin.
8	2	0	1	99	Ah, if only Alexander's father could speak now and give his advice!
9	0	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't need to do that to the corroded coins.
9	7	0	1	99	There's no point in using an object on itself.
9	5	0	1	99	Considering where those two coins have been for the past few hundred years (at least), Alexander prefers to touch them as little as possible.
9	1	0	1	99	The two coins from the skeleton in the catacombs are extremely old and corroded.
9	2	0	1	99	Much like their previous owner, the coins are speechless.
10	0	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't want to cut that with the ornate dagger.
10	8	0	1	99	
10	5	0	1	99	Alexander tests the weight of the dagger in his hand.  It's too light and small to be a fatal weapon, but it could certainly wound an assailant.
10	1	0	1	99	The small dagger is a gift from Lady Celeste.  Its handle is decorated with precious gems set in a delicate, feminine style.
12	0	0	1	99	It would be pointless to use that on the bottle of potion.
12	14	0	1	99	
12	5	0	1	99	Alexander searches the bottle for a clue about the potion inside, but remains unilluminated.
12	1	0	1	99	The little bottle contains some sort of potion and bears a label saying, "DRINK ME."  That's rather forward of it!
12	2	0	1	99	The bottle only communicates via its label.
13	0	0	1	99	Why would Alexander want to use that on the black feather?
13	30	0	1	99	
13	5	0	1	99	The feather feels very stiff and coarse.

14	47	0	1	99	
14	5	0	1	99	Alexander contemplates touching the flower, but doesn't want to get the flower's stench on his hands.
14	1	0	1	99	Colors of flame burst from the center of the incredibly stinky flower and drip onto its petals.  The flower's appearance is as flamboyant as its smell!
15	0	0	1	99	It's pointless to use that on the flute.
15	31	0	1	99	
15	5	0	1	99	The flute feels light and comfortable in Alexander's hands.
15	1	0	1	99	The little flute is carved from a single piece of wood and has tiny finger holes in the shaft.
16	0	0	1	99	There is no reason to use that on the gauntlet.
16	48	0	1	99	
16	5	0	1	99	The iron gauntlet is a bit small to fit on Alexander's arm.
16	1	0	1	99	The gauntlet is made of black iron and has a message inscribed upon it:
16	1	0	2	99	"Flesh may cross the portal,
					 and seek its master Death.
					 Flesh may go where Death has trod,
					 and challenge, like Scheherazade,
					 He Who Reins Beneath The Sod,
					 to spare a mortal's breath."
16	2	0	1	99	The gauntlet only speaks through the words inscribed on it.
17	0	0	1	99	That would have no effect on the ghostly ticket.
17	49	0	1	99	
17	5	0	1	99	Alexander can see his hand right through the transparent ticket.
17	1	0	1	99	The ghostly ticket reads, "Admit One."
60	0	0	1	99	There is no reason to do that to the strand of golden hair.   
60	45	0	1	99	Reattaching that strand of hair to the mantle of Beauty's clothes would be rather pointless.
60	15	0	1	99	
60	5	0	1	99	The strand of golden hair feels fine and glossy.

59	5	0	1	99	The strand of black hair is thick and still bears a trace of perfume.
59	1	0	1	99	The strand of hair from the red ribbon is the color of midnight.  Alexander can only hope that it belongs to his true love.
59	33	0	1	99	Reattaching that strand of hair to the hair ribbon would be rather pointless.

18	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to do that to the mother ghost's handkerchief.
18	50	0	1	99	
18	5	0	1	99	Touching the ghost handkerchief gives Alexander a strong mental impression of the mother ghost worriedly searching for her lost son.
18	1	0	1	99	Alexander is carrying the mother ghost's translucent handkerchief.
19	0	0	1	99	The hole-in-the-wall is doing just fine without that.
19	5	0	1	99	The hole-in-the-wall squirms slightly in Alexander's palm.
19	25	0	1	99	
19	1	0	1	99	The hole-in-the-wall has four legs and a curly tail.  He's all limbs with only a hole for a body, but that doesn't make him any less "whole."
19	2	0	1	99	A bit of the wallflowers' shyness seems to have rubbed off on the hole-in-the-wall, for he remains mute.
68	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the ink bottle.
68	5	0	1	99	Alexander shakes the bottle and imagines he hears a faint swishing sound, but decides he is mistaken.
68	5	50	1	99	Alexander examines the small bottle and determines that the invisible ink is, indeed, invisible.

66	2	0	1	99	There is nobody home right now.
23	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the lamp.
23	28	4	1	99	There's no reason to enchant the empty lamp.
23	28	10	1	99	The old hunter's lamp is already as "enchanted" as it's ever going to get!
23	28	9	1	97	!!!Do not print this.  Comment msg only. 
23	28	14	1	99	Spells must be cast over completely prepared spell ingredients.  The lamp ingredients are not yet ready for enchantment.

29	5	0	3	99	"It seems the plans for that little kingdom of yours are coming along.  I must congratulate you on your handling of the king and queen.  Isolating the islands so that no protest could develop was another brilliant stroke."

30	5	0	1	99	Alexander reads the love poem....
30	5	0	2	99	What was it when I looked at you?

31	12	0	1	99	
31	2	0	1	99	Though it possesses some magical capabilities, the map cannot talk.
32	0	0	1	99	It wouldn't be necessary to do that to the milk bottle.

					I cannot believe you are here, my friend! Please, please be careful!  Abdul isn't about to let anyone interfere with his plans.  Watch out for Abdul's genie, Alexander, and do not do anything rash.  I am not without resources, and I will prevail if I can only find some small means of defense.  Do nothing to try to get to me.  You must not be endangered again for my sake.
					
					Greatly in your family's debt,

11	2	0	1	99	The sentence seems to only have one thing to say, "Where are you going....?"

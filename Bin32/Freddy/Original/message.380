1	0	1	3	19	"....defeated the minotaur in his lair.  So I have seen."
1	0	1	4	19	"So this is the one that haunts my pool of late!  Welcome, young seeker.  What knowledge do you desire?"
1	0	1	5	2	"Princess Cassima.  Whatever you can tell me, great Oracle...."
1	0	1	6	19	"Ah!  Of course, the princess!  That explains my images.  Let us see what we can see."
1	0	1	7	19	"I see a maiden--lovely and pure, but surrounded by evil.  She is a rose set amidst bitter thorns."
1	0	1	8	19	"It is her fate to be the pawn of dark powers..."
1	0	1	9	19	"...and yours to try to redeem her!"
1	0	1	10	2	"How?  How do I redeem her?"
1	0	1	11	19	"Fate is not like the cut of a blade, young one, but rather like the myriad of paths formed when a hammer cracks ice.  I will tell you what I can, but what will actually come to pass is up to you."
1	0	1	12	19	"I see that any attempt to reach the girl will force you into battle, a struggle against a dark force.  If you lose, your life will be forfeit."
1	0	1	13	2	"Who must I fight?"
1	0	1	14	19	"A great darkness surrounds your adversary, preventing me from seeing clearly....  I can only make out the shape of a black cloak."
1	0	1	15	19	"But before this final struggle, I see an infiltration--a dangerous game of hide and seek in corridors filled with enemies.  The risks are high, but it is the only way to reach the one you seek."
1	0	1	16	19	"There is more than one way into this place.  Your choice will dictate much."
1	0	1	17	2	"What else do you see, mighty Oracle?"
1	0	1	18	19	"<gasp> Oooh....  Such pain!  I see two restless spirits crying out for revenge."
1	0	1	19	19	"These shades could help you destroy the dark force if they were to be brought back from their spiritual form, yet this is only one possible path to your destiny."
1	0	1	20	19	"I'm afraid this is getting beyond me.  I know very little about the afterlife.  I can only advise getting counsel from the Druids." 
1	0	1	21	19	"Be warned--the Druids are reclusive and dangerous.  They might aid you or they might destroy you.  Like their island, the Druid's nature is hidden in the mists." 
1	0	1	22	19	"There is nothing more I can do for you except to give you this...."
1	0	1	23	19	"It is water from the sacred pool.  That and my blessing go with you."
1	0	1	24	2	"Thank you, great Oracle."

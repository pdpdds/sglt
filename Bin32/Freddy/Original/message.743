1	0	1	2	2	"I'm sorry I could not spare you that grief, beloved."
1	0	2	1	28	"Oh, Alexander, I am so glad!  Between the return of my beloved parents and our new reign, you've made me so happy!"
1	0	2	2	2	"I'm glad I could make up for some of your suffering, my beautiful wife."
1	0	3	1	13	"Now, let us celebrate our good fortune!  The evil that has plagued this land is done, and a new reign begins!  Long live King Alexander and Queen Cassima!"
1	0	3	2	90	"LONG LIVE KING ALEXANDER!"
1	0	3	3	90	"LONG LIVE QUEEN CASSIMA!"
1	0	3	4	90	"LONG LIVE THE LAND OF THE GREEN ISLES!"
1	0	3	5	90	"Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!"
1	0	19	1	94	"Congratulations, King Alexander!  When we return home to Daventry, your crew will be glad to hear that their battle at sea was worthwhile--in bringing forth a new monarch!"
1	0	19	2	12	"We were so worried when your men arrived home without you, son!  I'm so thankful that you are safe and happy!"
1	0	19	3	2	"And I am as grateful that my crew did not pay for my driven heart!"
1	0	4	1	13	"King Alexander, there is a long road ahead.  The ferry must be repaired before we can reunite the islands."
1	0	5	1	13	"You have only brought us ALL good fortune, Sire!  With Shamir saved, and his power used for good, reuniting the islands will be far easier.  He has already repaired the ferry."
1	0	6	1	11	"Congratulations, my children!  I have an important question for you both, please hear me!"
1	0	6	2	2	"Yes, Sire?"
1	0	6	3	11	"Alexander, I welcome you into our family with open arms!  I placed trust in Alhazred because I so badly wanted a son and a husband for my beloved daughter.  I was wrong.  But you are true and good, Alexander, and have proven yourself to all my people."
1	0	6	4	2	"Thank you, Sire."
1	0	6	5	11	"Allaria and I have been through much.  Even though we have returned to our kingdom, I do not think we are able to reign again.  Will you two consider the Crown?  I know as king and queen you can heal this small kingdom from all the damage that Alhazred has inflicted upon it."
1	0	6	6	28	"Oh, Father!"
1	0	7	1	13	"Excuse my interrupting your joy, but I have an important question for the new bride and groom."
1	0	7	2	2	"What is it, Saladin?"
1	0	7	3	13	"Alexander, Alhazred hurt this little kingdom nearly to the point of destroying all that we stand for.  But you are true and good, and have proven yourself to all the people."
1	0	7	4	2	"Thank you, Captain."
1	0	7	5	13	"King Caliphim and Queen Allaria are gone and can never be restored.  Alhazred has, thankfully, been banished.  But we are leaderless.  I believe you two can heal this small kingdom from all the damage that Alhazred has inflicted upon it."
1	0	7	6	13	"Will you two, Alexander and Cassima, consider becoming the ruling king and queen?"
1	0	8	1	2	"Why, I'm honored....  What do you think, Cassima?"
1	0	8	2	97	!!!Removed this msg  "What is it that you wish, Cassima?"
1	0	8	3	28	"I love my homeland, Alexander.  I would be happy to stay and to serve it all my days."
1	0	9	1	2	"Father?  I believe I am needed here.  Would you be very disappointed if...."
1	0	9	2	94	"Son, you must follow your destiny.  I DO believe the Land of the Green Isles needs you.  You will be a magnificent king, though dearly missed in Daventry."
1	0	9	3	2	"Then, I accept."
1	0	9	4	12	"Oh, my boy!  What a man you've become, and how I will miss you!"
1	0	9	5	2	"Don't worry, Mother.  With Shamir's powers we'll be able to visit often!  I'm not about to forget my family."
1	0	9	6	95	"Congratulations, Alexander!  I'm so proud of you!"
1	0	9	7	2	"Thank you, dear sister."
1	0	10	1	2	"I wish my father were here so that I could ask his advice."
1	0	10	2	2	"I will miss him, and my mother and sister, and Daventry...."
1	0	10	3	2	"But I love you, Cassima, and I DO feel at home here.  Somehow, this land and I seem to suit each other.  I don't know what kind of a king I'll make, but...."
1	0	10	4	2	"I accept."
1	0	11	1	13	"Since the groom has no family present, I will speak on his behalf."
1	0	11	2	13	"Alexander, your union with this woman is sanctioned and recognized in the eyes of the community."
1	0	11	3	2	"Thank you, Saladin."
1	0	12	1	13	"Who will speak for the groom?"
1	0	12	2	94	"I will.  Alexander's mother and I recognize his marriage to Princess Cassima with glad hearts and sanction this union."
1	0	13	1	13	"Who gives this bride to be wed?"
1	0	13	2	11	"Her mother and I willingly give our daughter's hand in wedlock."
1	0	14	1	13	"Who gives this bride to be wed?"
1	0	14	2	5	"That would be me.  In the name of King Caliphim, beloved friend, I give his daughter, Cassima, in wedlock."
1	0	14	3	28	"Thank you, Jollo."
1	0	15	1	13	"Then, Alexander and Cassima, I now pronounce you man and wife.  You may kiss the bride."
1	0	15	2	90	"Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!"
1	0	16	1	99	Cassima and Alexander ask Captain Saladin to perform their wedding ceremony.  Saladin is honored to do so.
1	0	16	2	13	"On this historical day of great joy in the Land of the Green Isles, we witness the union of Cassima, beloved princess of this realm, and Alexander, prince of Daventry!"
1	0	17	1	13	"Your road will be easier now that the islands are no longer feuding.  Already the wounds are starting to heal."
1	0	17	2	28	"Yes, my love, discovering the island's stolen treasures has done more to bring peace to this land than anything else.  It is now clear that Alhazred had Shamir steal each of the island's most valued treasure, then blamed the thefts on others to cause the islands to hate each other."
1	0	18	1	13	"Unfortunately, the islands are still feuding.  It will take some time, and great diplomacy, to convince them to reunite and stop fighting each other."
1	0	18	2	28	"Yes, Alexander.  We will have to try to discover how Alhazred managed to make them hate each other so that we can undo what he has done."

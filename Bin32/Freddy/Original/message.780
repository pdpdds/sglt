7	1	0	1	99	The comfortable-looking bed in the corner is neatly arranged.  It looks just large enough for Jollo's generous size.
14	5	0	1	99	Alexander isn't in need of a candelabra.
14	1	0	1	99	Jollo uses a brass candelabra to illuminate his writing.
11	5	0	1	99	Jollo needs that chair more than Alexander does.
11	1	0	1	99	The wooden chair by the desk gleams with the patina of heavy use and careful polishing.
15	5	0	1	99	Alexander can't reach the chandelier.
15	1	0	1	99	A chandelier hangs down from the tall ceiling.  How on earth does Jollo reach that thing to light it?
10	0	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't need to leave that on Jollo's desk.
10	5	0	1	99	Alexander respects Jollo's privacy and leaves his desk alone.
10	1	0	1	99	Jollo keeps his desk neat and tidy.
5	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the door.

5	1	13	1	99	Jollo's door leads out into the basement hallway.
5	1	13	2	99	There's a keyhole in the door.
5	1	14	1	99	Alexander peers through the keyhole of Jollo's door.
5	1	14	2	99	It looks like the hallway outside is clear.  There are no guard dogs in sight.
9	0	0	1	99	Ah, to consume all our earthly possessions in flame!
9	5	0	1	99	And burn a perfectly good hand?
9	1	0	1	99	A cozy little fire is ablaze in Jollo's fireplace.

4	0	0	2	5	"I'm afraid I wouldn't know what to do with that, Prince Alex.  Sorry."
4	5	0	1	5	"Please stop, Prince Alex!  I'm really ticklish!"
4	43	12	1	2	"Are you sure you can't swap this lamp for the genie's?"
4	43	12	2	5	"Alas, no.  Sorry, Prince Alex."
4	43	11	1	2	"I've been thinking about what you said about swapping a replica for the genie's lamp.   Do you think this lamp would pass?"  
4	43	11	2	5	"Ugg!  No!  That's nothing like the genie's lamp.  The genie's lamp looks shiny and new.  I'd never be able to make a swap with an old hunter's lamp like that!" 
4	43	11	3	2	"I see.  That's too bad."
4	43	11	4	5	"Well, perhaps it was too much to hope for in any case.  I guess you'll have to make do with your other plans, Alexander.  Good luck."
4	57	12	1	2	"Are you sure you can't swap this lamp for the genie's?"  
4	57	12	2	5	"Alas, no.  Sorry, Prince Alex." 
4	57	11	1	2	"I've been thinking about what you said about swapping a replica for the genie's lamp.  I got this lamp from the old lampseller in town.  Do you think it will pass?"
4	57	11	2	5	"No, I don't think so.  I know what the genie's lamp looks like, and that's not it.  It's a new lamp all right, but there's something wrong with it.  I'm afraid I can't make a swap with that lamp."

4	56	11	2	5	"Why...YES!  It's an exact replica!  That's amazing!  How did you guess?"
4	56	11	3	2	"I suppose it was intuition."
4	56	11	4	5	"Hmmm....  I'll have to wait for the right moment, mind you, but I should be able to get close enough to swap this for the real thing--and none shall be the wiser!  Now you shall see Jollo's skill!"
4	56	11	5	2	"I'm sure your hands are mightier than my sword, my clever friend."
4	56	11	6	5	"(DELIGHTED) Hee, hee!  Go ahead and do as you've planned, and let me worry about swapping the lamp.  If I accomplish the trickery, I'll manage to get the lamp to you somehow, never fear!"
4	56	11	7	2	"I have faith, Jollo.  You're a true friend."
4	56	11	8	5	"Aw, shucks!  I would do anything for the princess."
4	61	0	1	99	Jollo is not in a position to do anything about the vizier's treachery.  Reading the letter would just make him more upset.
4	1	0	1	99	Jollo occupies himself with his writing, but the frown on his brow indicates his anxiety about the fate of his beloved princess.
4	35	0	1	2	"Could you make use of this key, Jollo?"
4	35	0	2	5	"No, thanks, Prince Alex.  I can get pretty much anywhere in the castle that I need to as it is.  It might serve you better."
4	2	0	1	2	"Is there anything else you can do that will help me in the castle?"
4	2	0	2	5	"I'm afraid not, Prince Alex.  One will get past the guard dogs easier than two.  Besides, I'm not much of a fighter."
4	2	0	3	5	"But if you intend to do as you've said, you should lose no time about it.  The wedding will be starting before you know it!"
4	2	15	1	2	"Jollo!  I've seen Cassima!"
4	2	15	2	5	"Really?  How is she?  Is she well?"
4	2	15	3	2	"She seems fine at the moment, but she does NOT want to marry Alhazred!"
4	2	15	4	5	"Then you must do what you can to prevent that from happening, Alexander!"
4	2	15	5	2	"I intend to, friend."
4	2	15	6	5	"Be careful, Alexander.  Let me know if there's any way I can help."
13	5	0	1	99	The circus notice belongs to Jollo.
13	1	0	1	99	The wall above Jollo's desk sports a notice of a circus.  It seems very old.
3	0	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't want to disturb anything in Jollo's room.
3	5	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't want to disturb anything in Jollo's room.
3	1	0	1	99	Jollo's bedroom is spacious, neat, and lush with dramatic colors.  Like its resident, there's a melancholy sheen to its brightness.
8	5	0	1	99	Alexander couldn't possibly carry that heavy rug with him!  Besides, Jollo might miss it!
8	1	0	1	99	A large, red rug with gold trim helps buffer the coldness of the marble floor underfoot.
1	0	9	1	5	"Prince Alexander!  I can't believe you're here!  The wedding is supposed to start any minute!"
1	0	9	2	2	"I am well aware of that fact, Jollo.  Confound it!  I've seen Cassima.  She does NOT want to marry him, Jollo!"
1	0	9	3	5	"Really?  Oh, my friend, I'm so happy for that!  Thank heaven she hasn't lost her senses and actually fallen for that black-hearted Alhazred!  Did you say that she is well?"
1	0	9	4	2	"She is unharmed if that's what you mean--for the moment, at least.  But I have a feeling she won't be fine at all if we can't stop the wedding."
1	0	9	5	5	"Stop the wedding?  You'd never even make it to the ceremony, Alexander.  The guard dogs are everywhere, and they're very loyal to the Crown.  Unfortunately, right now, 'the Crown' means Alhazred."
1	0	9	6	5	"If we had proof of something truly afoul, the guard dogs might listen.  As it is, they're your enemies, not his."
1	0	9	7	2	"(DRYLY, ALMOST BITTER) I understand.  I've had no lack of 'enemies' since I got here.  Still, I can hardly stand by and do nothing."
1	0	16	1	5	"You found my room!  Good!  You'll be safe here for a little while.  I couldn't risk asking in the hall, but what are you doing here?  The wedding is supposed to start any minute!"
1	0	10	1	5	"There's probably a good reason why so many wish to harm you.  I believe the vizier's genie has learned of your presence on the islands."
1	0	10	2	2	"Tell me about this genie."
1	0	10	3	5	"Alhazred brought the genie with him when he came to this kingdom.  It is seldom that the genie will take human life himself.  Usually, he is more of a trickster and spy, but that doesn't mean he isn't dangerous."
1	0	10	4	5	"In fact, he is quite powerful.  If, for example, we could get the genie's lamp, then you could master the genie.  Alhazred and all our other problems would be solved."
1	0	10	5	2	"Hmmm.  Is that merely wishful thinking or do you have something in mind?"
1	0	10	6	5	"Well...I admit, I have often daydreamed about owning that lamp.  My fingers are nimble enough, and I could probably find the chance to steal it.  Unfortunately, the theft would be detected immediately, and I happen to prefer my neck attached to my body!"
1	0	10	7	2	"IF the theft were detected."
1	0	10	8	5	"(EXCITED) Exactly!  So I have also thought!  If I had a replica of the genie's lamp, an EXACT replica, I just might be able to...."
1	0	10	9	5	"Bah!  Where would we get a replica of the genie's lamp?  Ah, dreaming is pleasant, but I'm afraid it won't help you stop the wedding.  But, for Cassima's sake, I wish you luck."
1	0	10	10	5	"I'll be here if you can think of anything I can do to help."
1	0	10	11	2	"Thanks, Jollo."
1	0	8	1	5	"Prince Alexander!  I can't believe it!  How did you get into the castle?"
1	0	8	2	2	"Well, I....  Actually, it's a little hard to explain."
1	0	8	3	5	"I bet!  You run a terrible risk being here!  The castle is crawling with guard dogs--especially today!  The vizier will have your hide if he finds you!"
1	0	8	4	2	"I know that, Jollo, but Cassima is being married today.  What greater risk is there than that?"
1	0	8	5	5	"Of course, you're right.  Young love--I forget what heartburn it is!  But what do you propose to do about it?"
1	0	8	6	2	"I've GOT to try to see her, maybe even stop the wedding."
1	0	8	7	5	"Is that all?  And here I thought you would try something dangerous <sigh>."
1	0	8	8	2	"Don't worry about me, friend.  Just tell me; where is Cassima?"
1	0	8	9	5	"As far as I know, she's still in her bedroom upstairs.  You'd never make it up there, though.  The guard dogs are everywhere, and they're very loyal to the Crown.  Unfortunately, right now 'the Crown' means Alhazred."
1	0	8	10	5	"If we had proof of something truly afoul, the guard dogs might listen.  As it is, they're your enemies, not his."
1	0	8	11	2	"(DRYLY, ALMOST BITTER) I understand.  I've had no lack of 'enemies' since I got here.  In fact, you'd almost think I wasn't welcome."
1	0	17	1	5	"You found my room!  Good!  You'll be safe here for a little while.  I couldn't risk asking in the hall, but how did you get into the castle in the first place?"
1	0	4	1	5	"Not if the princess wishes her freedom, no.  Let me know if there's any way I can help.  For Cassima's sake, I wish you luck.  I'll be here if there's anything you need."
1	0	4	2	2	"Thanks, Jollo."

1	0	2	1	5	"Hah!  And they say princes have no sense of humor!  Well, I can see there's no putting you off.  For Cassima's sake, I wish you luck.  I'll be here if there's anything you need."
1	0	2	2	2	"Thanks, Jollo."

1	0	1	3	5	"Not as sorry as you're going to be!  GUARDS!!  GUARDS!!"
1	0	1	4	6	"What is it, Jollo?"
1	0	1	5	5	"This man is an intruder!  He's probably here to harm the princess!"

1	0	18	3	5	"We'll see about that!  GUARDS!!  GUARDS!!"
1	0	18	4	6	"What is it, Jollo?"
1	0	18	5	5	"The intruder escaped from the dungeon!  Grab him!"
1	0	18	6	6	"He won't get away again, Jollo, and that's a fact!"
1	0	19	1	99	Alexander hears the guard dog leave the basement.  It seems he's safe for the moment.
12	5	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't want to intrude on Jollo's privacy by looking through his trunk.
12	1	0	1	99	A plain trunk provides minimal storage for the bedroom.

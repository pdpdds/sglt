10	37	0	1	99	That's an interesting idea, but Alexander might want to rethink his placement strategy.

8	5	16	1	99	Alexander ducks behind the pillar.

8	5	15	1	99	The guard dogs have stopped at the north end of the hall and are not patrolling for the moment.  There's no need to hide behind the pillar.
8	1	0	1	99	A red marble pillar acts as a partial divider, helping to set the alcove off from the main corridor.
11	1	0	1	99	Kindly smiles light up the faces of the couple in the painting.  The man has an intelligent, sensitive look about him, and the woman is quite lovely.
11	1	0	2	99	Alexander guesses that the man and woman in the painting are none other than King Caliphim and Queen Allaria, Cassima's parents.

4	5	12	1	99	Alexander puts the heavy portrait back on the wall. 
4	5	13	1	99	Alexander can't return the portrait to the wall now that he's taken the nail.
4	5	10	1	99	Alexander checks behind the portrait.
4	1	0	1	99	Alexander takes a closer look at the portrait on the wall. 
4	64	0	1	99	The nail would only mar the lovely portrait!

3	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the alcove.
3	5	0	1	99	The alcove marble is as smooth, cool, and featureless as the marble in the main hall.
3	1	0	1	99	Alexander is standing in a small, curved alcove in the upstairs hallway of the castle.  A pillar partially blocks the alcove from the main corridor.
3	2	0	1	99	The alcove might be a good place to hold a private conversation, but Alexander does not have anyone to talk to.
1	0	2	1	99	The mechanical song echoes in the corridor.  Alexander hears the sound of boots pounding as the guard dogs come to investigate.
1	0	2	2	6	"Look at this, Wolf!  A metal bird!"
1	0	2	3	7	"Sure is, Bay.  How do you suppose a metal bird got in here?"
1	0	2	4	6	"You got me, but there's somethin' weird about....  Hey!  Could this be Cassima's nightingale, do you think?"
1	0	2	5	7	"What?  You lapdog!  The princess's nightingale isn't some tin thing!"
1	0	2	6	6	"How do you know?  Have you seen it?"
1	0	2	7	7	"Well.  No, but...."
1	0	2	8	6	"I don't know, Bay.  Humans can be pretty strange.  <Growf> With THEIR sense of smell, maybe she wouldn't even know it wasn't real.  I say we take it downstairs to Captain Saladin.  He'll know what to do with it."
1	0	2	9	7	"What about our post?"
1	0	2	10	6	"Jowels and Mite are in the other hallway.  They can handle it for five minutes.  Think about how happy the princess'd be to get her nightingale back."
1	0	2	11	6	"And then there's that reward money and my missus...."
1	0	2	12	7	"Right, Wolf.  Let's go."
1	0	2	13	99	Alexander hears the guard dogs' boots clank noisily on the staircase leading down to the grand hall.
1	0	1	1	99	Alexander hears the guards' footsteps pause for a moment, then start up again.
1	0	1	2	99	They must have turned at the end of the hallway and be on their way back towards the stairs.
1	0	3	1	99	Alexander hears the guards approaching from the stairs.
1	0	3	2	6	"If you didn't have the brain of a cat, Wolf, you'd have known that mechanical nightingale wasn't Cassima's nightingale!" 
1	0	3	3	7	"Me?  I was all for stayin' on patrol, but you wanted to show the thing to Saladin!"
1	0	3	4	6	"Well....  At least the Captain wasn't too mad.  He's a good honest dog, Saladin is."
1	0	3	5	7	"Aye, <ruff>.  Wish the same could be said of our...."
1	0	3	6	6	"HUSH!  Do you want to be dazzled, you fool?"
1	0	3	7	99	Somewhere nearby, a door opens.
1	0	3	8	6	"<ahem> Greetings, Shamir...sir."
1	0	3	9	99	A petulant voice snaps a response at the guards.
1	0	3	10	32	"The wedding is about to begin.  Make sure everything's secure!"
1	0	3	11	6	"Yes, sir!"
1	0	3	12	99	Footsteps retreat down the hall towards the back hallway.
1	0	3	13	99	Alexander hears the distant sound of chains rattling.  A door opens....
1	0	3	14	99	There's a small commotion and a woman's sharp cry.
1	0	3	15	2	...Cassima!...
1	0	3	16	99	Gradually the sounds fade away off to the east.  All is silent.
1	0	3	17	6	"(KEEPING HIS VOICE LOW, BUT OUTRAGED)Here now!  If it weren't for him bein' the vizier's page and all, I'd have somethin' to say about that!"
1	0	3	18	6	"<GRRR> Wonder where he's taking her?  The wedding's the other way."
1	0	3	19	7	"You never know with that one.  He's always showin' up when he shouldn't be and goin' where he oughtn't.  Let's go check it out."
1	0	3	20	99	The guard dogs seem to have stopped at the back hallway.

1	0	17	1	6	"Hey!  Look, Wolf!  There's a man back here!"
1	0	17	2	2	"Hello, there!  Um...nice painting."
1	0	17	3	7	"Get 'em, Bay!"
1	0	20	1	6	"Hey!  Look, Wolf!  There's a metal bird on the floor!  And there's a man in the alcove!"
1	0	21	1	6	"Hey!  Look, Wolf!  There's a man in the alcove!  He must have been the one who tried to fool us with that fake bird!"
1	0	19	1	6	"Hey!  Look, Wolf!  The king and queen's portrait fell down!"
1	0	19	2	2	"Er...sorry.  I was just looking at it."
1	0	19	3	7	"Get 'em, Bay!"
1	0	6	1	99	Here come the guards!  Alexander does his best to hide.
1	0	6	2	99	The guards pass the pillar, and Alexander sighs in relief.  They didn't see him!
1	0	6	3	99	The guards turn around at the staircase and head back.
1	0	6	4	99	Phew!  That was a close one. 
1	0	8	1	99	Here they come again.
1	0	8	2	99	And there they go. 
1	0	7	1	99	The sound of footsteps grows louder as the guards in the main hallway turn and head back towards the stairs. 
1	0	9	1	97	!!!Do not print this!  Comment msg only. 
1	0	5	1	99	From downstairs, Alexander hears the first wafting strains of music.  Hmmm.  It's beautiful music....
1	0	5	2	99	It's wedding music!!!!!  
1	0	5	3	99	The music has attracted the guards' attention.  Alexander hears them coming down the hallway.
1	0	5	4	6	"Just a minute, Wolf, I want to pay my respects to the king and queen before we go down for the weddin'."
1	0	5	5	7	"What a nice idea, Bay.  I will too."
1	0	5	6	6	"Hey!  It's a man!"
1	0	5	7	7	"I bet he was the one what tried to trick us with that metal bird!"
1	0	5	8	2	"It WAS me, actually.  Sorry.  But now I really must get down to that wedding."
1	0	5	9	6	"<GROWL> You'll be getting downstairs all right--but a little lower than the throne room!  Let's get 'em, Wolf!"
9	5	0	1	99	The curved marble wall yields nothing of interest to Alexander's fingers.
9	64	0	1	99	Alexander puts the nail back into the wall.

1	0	3	1	99	That won't do anything for the little oyster.
1	0	4	1	99	Perhaps Alexander should find out more about the oyster first.
1	42	5	1	2	"Would you like me to read to you again?"
1	42	4	1	99	Perhaps Alexander should find out more about the oyster first.
1	42	7	1	99	The oyster is already asleep, and if Alexander reads anymore of THAT book HE will fall asleep.
1	42	8	1	99	The oyster is resting rather uneasily, and Alexander doesn't want to disturb him.
1	30	2	1	99	The oyster would not appreciate being tickled awake!
1	30	9	1	99	The little oyster looks far too grumpy to enjoy a good tickling.
1	31	2	1	99	Alexander doesn't want to disturb the oyster now that he's finally asleep!
1	31	9	1	2	"Should I play the flute for you?"
1	31	9	2	37	"No, thanks!  Music just keeps me awake."
1	5	2	1	99	Alexander doesn't want to wake up the sleeping oyster.
1	5	3	1	2	"(CONCERNED) Why don't you let me see if I can help?"
1	5	3	2	37	"(LIKE A SCARED KID) No way!  No one's looking in MY mouth!  I HATE dentists."
1	5	4	1	99	That oyster already looks a little perturbed and probably wouldn't appreciate being picked up by Alexander.
1	1	9	1	99	One of the oysters is sitting up in bed and doesn't look very happy.  He seems to be the only one who can't sleep.
1	1	9	2	99	In the oyster's mouth Alexander can see a glint of white.
1	1	7	1	99	The little oyster is sleeping peacefully now that Alexander's removed the irritating pearl.
1	1	8	1	99	The oyster with the mouthache seems to be resting rather uneasily.
1	66	0	1	99	The oyster is sleeping peacefully without that pearl and would be unlikely to want it back!

1	2	10	1	2	"Why aren't you asleep like the other oysters?"
1	2	10	2	37	"I'm SO weary, but I can't sleep.  I have a terrible ache in my mouth."
1	2	11	1	2	"What's wrong with your mouth?"
1	2	11	2	37	"No offense, but it hurts too much to talk."

7	3	16	1	99	The ocean is not as calm as it appears.  Underwater currents tug at Alexander's legs.
7	3	17	1	99	The underwater tow is amazingly strong here.  It pulls ferociously at Alexander's legs.
7	3	17	2	99	Before Alexander can retreat, the currents grab his legs!  The shifting sand vanishes from beneath his feet!  Against his best efforts, he is dragged out to sea!

8	5	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't wish to disturb the oysters who are sleeping soundly.
8	1	0	1	99	Oyster beds line the seashore.  Most of the oysters are sound asleep.
8	2	0	1	99	The sleeping oysters only snore in response.
6	0	0	1	99	There's no reason for Alexander to use that on the rocks.
6	5	0	1	99	Alexander doesn't need to carry around the dead weight of a rock.
6	1	0	1	99	Large, craggy boulders lie on the beach as though pushed up from the sea by giant hands.
6	2	0	1	99	The rocks don't answer.
9	0	0	1	99	There's no reason to use that on the path.
9	5	0	1	99	To take the path, Alexander need only walk down it.
9	1	0	1	99	A path to the north leads inland.
9	2	0	1	99	The path wanders on its way without comment.
10	1	0	1	99	Alexander is standing on a rocky beach.  To the north is dense, tropical vegetation.  Near the shore are a dozen or so oyster beds.
10	3	19	1	99	Alexander hears someone coming.
10	3	19	2	36	"Five fierce guards of the isle we be!
					'Watch for a foreign man,' said he!
					With ears and nose, tongue, hands, and eyes.
					Its nature cannot be disguised.
					If man it be, then man it dies!"  
11	0	0	1	99	Using that on the sentence in the water would be pointless.
11	5	0	1	99	Alexander picks up the object floating in the water.  It appears to be a string of letters.  They say "Where are you going....?"
11	5	0	2	99	Alexander decides to keep the odd sentence, even though it is incomplete.
11	5	20	1	99	Alexander wades into the sea to get the strange object in the water.
11	5	20	2	99	The ocean currents tug at Alexander's legs.  Hmmm.  That object is just a bit out of reach.
11	5	21	1	99	Alexander wades deeper into the sea to get the strange object in the water.
11	1	0	1	99	A string of letters floats in the water.  The letters spell out, "Where are you going....?"  Alexander's heard of alphabet soup, but this is ridiculous!
11	2	0	1	99	The sentence floating in the water has nothing new to say.

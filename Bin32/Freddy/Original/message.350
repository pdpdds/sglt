7	5	0	1	99	Alexander cannot reach the Oracle's cave from here.
7	1	0	1	99	Rearing tall behind the city is the peak of the Sacred Mountain.  The Oracle's cave is gashed into the face of the mountain like a wound.     
7	2	0	1	99	No one in the Oracle's cave could hear Alexander from here.

3	5	0	1	99	The Winged Ones' guards would not appreciate Alexander poking around outside their city gates.    
3	1	0	1	99	Alexander is standing in front of the gates to the City of the Winged Ones.  The city entrance is accented with huge marble pillars and an ornate marble gate.  Beyond the gate, Alexander can barely make out a community of nests atop large pillars.  The peak of the mountain that makes up the Isle of the Sacred Mountain towers above the city.   
3	1	0	2	99	Two extremely handsome and athletic-looking young men with large white wings are standing guard in front of the city gates.
3	2	0	1	99	If Alexander wishes to speak with anyone here, he might address the Winged Ones' guards.   
1	0	1	1	18	"(AMAZED, ALARMED) Look!  An intruder!"      
1	0	1	2	31	"(COLD, VICIOUS) Hold!  How did you get up here, human?"     
1	0	1	3	2	"(POLITE, A LITTLE NERVOUS) I climbed the cliffs."   
1	0	1	4	18	"(DISDAINFUL) That is not possible!  No one has solved the Cliffs of Logic in several centuries--and if the cliffs WERE to be solved, it would certainly not be by a HUMAN!"       
1	0	1	5	2	"I...I didn't mean to trespass.  I only wanted to visit this beautiful island."    
1	0	1	6	31	"No visitors have been welcome on the Isle of the Sacred Mountain in years!  Not since the red and white queens had spies in the guise of 'friendly visitors' steal our island's sacred golden fleece!"       
1	0	1	7	18	"But we will not display such foolish trust again!  You will have to answer to Lord Azure and Lady Aeriel.  They will determine what will be done with you!  I can assure you, it will not be pleasant!"

4	0	0	1	2	"Would you have any interest in this?" 
4	0	0	2	18	"We have no interest in anything of yours, human!"   
4	5	0	1	99	The cold attitude of the guards makes Alexander reluctant to touch them--however tempting the sheen of their beautiful wings might be.  
4	1	0	1	99	The Winged Ones' guards are perfect specimens--tall and straight, regally formed.  Their wings are thickly muscled and incredibly strong, like the legs of a thoroughbred horse.  But their faces, however handsome, reflect a certain cold haughtiness.      
4	2	8	1	2	"Are you sure I can't revisit the city?"   
4	2	8	2	18	"You are not welcome here, human!  Be gone!"    
4	2	0	1	2	"Greetings, guards of the City of the Winged Ones.  Would you be able to take me back to the city, or perhaps, the Oracle?"   
4	2	0	2	18	"Lord Azure asked you to not return and you agreed!  Dare you break your word?"  
4	2	0	3	2	"Er...no.  I suppose not.  Sorry."
